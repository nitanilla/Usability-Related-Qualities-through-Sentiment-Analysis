      "body": "## What is this?\r\n\r\nRocket.Chat Apps can provide a starting point for bespoke chat ops / messaging automation, to replace the current Internal Hubot.\r\n\r\nNote the distinction between _internal_ and _external_ bots:\r\n\r\n- External hosted bots use a platform or framework adapter to login and operate a user account. They are suited to messaging-heavy interactions and/or where maintenance or processes are independent of Rocket.Chat.\r\n- Internal bots are tightly coupled with the architecture of Rocket.Chat, but (at least currently) have limited features for conversational UI. Their provisioning and operation is dependent on the Rocket.Chat server.\r\n\r\n## Why do it?\r\n\r\nThe internal Hubot is outdated, it’s utility for enterprises and teams is limited and its documentation and usability is a challenge blocking many users from making the most of it.\r\n\r\nRocket.Chat now has much better options for messaging automation from progress toward an app marketplace model and the recent updates towards an SDK for multiple bot platform/framework adapters.\r\n\r\nIntegrating custom processes into the core codebase and the generic “Rocket.Cat” bot identity is harder to maintain and can be confusing for users to interact with.\r\n\r\n## How will it help?\r\n\r\n- Instances can maintain bot driven logic without requiring a fork of core Rocket.Chat\r\n- Customised identity for bots in a Rocket.Chat instance distinct from the “system bot”\r\n- Clearer semantics between system notifications and instance’s specific business logic\r\n- Access to apps API endpoints will open new features to internal bots\r\n- Multiple internal bots can provide different behaviours from unique bot user profiles\r\n\r\n## What does it need?\r\n\r\n- App with same features as a bot: receive, send, reply, store data, call API\r\n- Provide http listeners for triggering internal methods / interactions\r\n- Make http requests to get data to trigger or populate a message send\r\n- Documentation for getting started with defining a new bot app and writing scripts\r\n- Boilerplate examples to show simple common use cases achieved by bot app\r\n\r\n## What’s the plan?\r\n\r\n- Identify some use cases of current internal Hubot extensions\r\n- Build and document example implementations with Rocket.Chat Apps to replace Internal Hubot interactions\r\n- Build a replacement for Rocket.Cat as default packaged app-bot\r\n- Update docs for a clear purpose for the single system bot as a simple service butler, that will no longer be extended with instance specific scripts.\r\n\r\n## How can we help?\r\n\r\nIf this spec effects you and you’d like to help out, what we need at this stage is to understand the types of use cases currently implemented with the Internal Hubot, so we can provide useful templates and guides to migrate your Hubot scripts into Rocket.Chat apps.\r\n\r\nRelated to #10456, #6640, #8025 ",

The user interface for Idle Time Limit does not specify the unit in which the timeout is being configured\r\n\r\nThe combination of these made for a very vexing issue that took a long time to isolate, where the search sidebar was totally unusable due to constantly closing every few milliseconds, making it impossible to search for and contact someone.\r\n\r\n### Server Setup Information:\r\n\r\n* Version of Rocket.Chat Server: 0.63.1\r\n* Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS  (4.4.0-119-generic)\r\n* Deployment Method(snap/docker/tar/etc): SNAP\r\n* Number of Running Instances: 1\r\n* DB Replicaset Oplog: Enabled?\r\n* Node Version: v8.9.4\r\n* mongoDB Version: v3.2.7\r\n\r\n### Client Binary\r\n\r\n* Rocket.Chat+ Version 2.10.5\r\n* Windows 7 Professional x64 Service Pack 1\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Adjust the automatic-away idle time limit to something really low:\r\nMy Account → Preferences → USER PRESENCE → Idle Time Limit: 300\r\n2. Go back to normal messaging, then press the magnifying glass \"Search\" button to bring up the Search sidebar.\r\n3. Observe that in 300 milliseconds or less, the search bar closes, making it unusable for searching.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior:\r\n\r\nThe search sidebar does not close.\r\nThe Idle Time Limit specifies the unit of time.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior:\r\n\r\nThe search sidebar closes too quickly for usability.\r\nThe Idle Time Limit does not specify the unit of time.",

      "body": "### Introduction\n\nEffective use of EHRs is recognized as a key element in achieving the Triple Aim—improving the patient experience of care (including quality and satisfaction), improving the health of populations and reducing the per capita cost of health care. Yet health care workers report unprecedented levels of burnout and dissatisfaction. This trend has prompted expansion of the Triple Aim to the Quadruple Aim [[1](http://www.annfammed.org/content/12/6/573.full)], which adds the goal of improving the work life of health care workers, both clinicians and non-clinicians, to the original three initiatives. EHR technology is cited as a major contributing factor to physician burnout [[2](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR400/RR439/RAND_RR439.pdf)]. Family Physicians have colloquially advocated for \"Replacing the WHACK [-a-Mole implementation of EHR driven workflows] with the LAC [Life After Clinic]\" as vision for what how improved EHR usability should reclaim time spent currently on after-hours documentation for the personal lives of clinicians.\n\nHere, usability challenges will be defined as product features or situations in which the design and implementation of EHRs do not align with the cognitive and/or workflow requirements and preferences of users within and across professional and patient roles and settings. This memo aims to describe the usability challenges that affect the clinician-patient relationship, which represent strategies by which the use of SHR can be promoted. This memo will aid in prioritizing key features of SHR development, which represent the tactics by which SHR will promote usability.\n### The structure of the broader problem of usability challenges\n\nTaking the above definition a a starting place, several interrelated domains emerge.\n- _Product design versus implementation_\n  Poor EHR design limits the potential for physician-patient engagement by interfering with face-to-face interaction with patients. Many local implementations of EHR products have been customized in an attempt to suit local needs, but the quality of these implementations varies greatly. EHR implementation is often viewed as a fixed cost, rather than an ongoing investment, requiring regular updates, training and iteration to function optimally.\n- _Cognitive requirements versus workflow requirements_\n  Current EHRs focus primarily on data collection rather than synthesis of data at the patient level. Current data synthesis methods are typically neither context nor patient specific. The lack of context awareness can lead to frequent clinical and administrative reminders that may force physicians to make hard stops, even for non-urgent matters, to address these issues. Features such as pop-up reminders, cumbersome menus and poor user interfaces interrupt workflow and  increase cognitive demands by forcing users to \"hunt\" through the interface to retrieve data, record data, and trigger actions in the clinical workflow. \n- _Best practices versus preferences_\n  Physicians have not defined the clinical workflows health data products, such as EHRs, need to support. As a speciality that prides itself on individual excellence through purposeful effort and autonomous decision making, physicians may recoil to the notion that clinical workflows should be adapted to the needs of EHR systems. \n- _Variation within professional roles_\n  Few EHR systems are built to accommodate physicians’ practice patterns and work flows, which vary depending on size, specialty and setting. Within one practice setting, workers of the same professional designation may have different roles based on unique training, responsibilities or level of experience (e.g. resident physician vs attending physician, medical assistant versus master medical assistant).\n- _Variation across professional roles_\n  The scope of practice of non-physician health care professionals varies according to state licensure laws. Current technology often requires clinicians to enter data or perform tasks that other team members could be empowered to complete by preventing delegation of tasks as appropriate.\n- _Variation across settings_\n  Various characteristics external to an EHR system - e.g. architectural, staffing, patient population - can profoundly affect the successful implementation of an EHR within a given clinical setting.\n- _Professionals versus patients_\n  EHR design has been heavily influenced by the data capture and billing needs of clinicians, and external influences (e.g. meaningful use) not relevant to the clinician-patient encounter. Most EHR systems are not designed to support digital patient engagement. Failure to incorporate increased interoperability between EHR systems, mHealth platforms, and telehealth technologies represents a missed opportunity to promote health and wellness and manage chronic illnesses.\n### Not all usability challenges are directly related to EHR software design\n\nAs noted above, a number of factors external to EHRs may have considerable effects on usability, such as:\n- sub-optimal implementation\n- risk management concerns\n- institutional liability concerns\n- regulatory requirements \n- inadequate training of users\n- suboptimal practice workflow processes \n### Not all clinician-patient interactions involve face-to-face encounters utilizing EHRs\n\nAt least 7 types of physician-patient encounter are envisioned in the health care system of the near future. The majority of these encounter types do not require use of an EHR at the point of care, which allows the possibility that a light weight alternative application could service the health data requirements of the patient and clinician.\n\n|  | _Synchronous_ | _Asynchronous_ |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| _EHR Necessary_ | Face-to-face | EHR portal message |\n| _EHR Optional_ | Video chat, Telephone | Secure email,  Secure SMS, App-based messaging |\n### Key usability challenges physicians face with current EHRs\n\nThe American Medical Association identified key challenges physicians face with current EHRs [[3](https://www.aace.com/files/ehr-priorities.pdf)]. Of these, several deal directly with usability challenges within the clinician-patient interaction.\n- Interference with the patient visit\n- Issues with care coordination due to lack of interoperability\n- Increased cognitive workload for physicians\n- Lack of system-design support for team-based care\n- Communicating with patients in a changing digital landscape\n\nOther key usability challenges deal more directly with the design and implementation of specific EHR products.\n- Lack of data liquidity and high switching costs\n- Lack of product modularity to support unique physician practices and population needs\n- Insufficient support for incorporating end-user input into product design and post-implementation feedback for product improvement\n### Usability priorities\n\nBased on these challenges, the AMA recommends eight EHR usability priorities to be urgently addressed. Of these, half relate directly to the clinician-patient interaction.\n\n**_Not Directly Related to Clinician Patient Interaction**_\n3) Promote care coordination.\n4) Offer product modularity and configurability.\n6) Promote interoperability and data exchange.\n8) Expedite user input into product design and post-implementation feedback.\n\n**_Directly Related to Clinician Patient Interaction**_\n1) Enhance physicians’ ability to provide high-quality patient care \n- Promote effective communication and engagement between patients and physicians \n- Reconfigure EHR interface seamlessly into the practice  \n- Rearrange electronic devices in the care setting to limit distractions. |\n\n2) Support team-based care\n- Allow physicians, or AI-agents, to dynamically allocate and delegate work to appropriate members of the care team as permitted by institutional policies. |\n\n5) Reduce cognitive work load\n- Manage information flow and adjust for context, environment and user preferences. \n- Balance use of unstructured narrative data, which many physicians find more succinct and reflective of the patient’s perspective and physician’s thought process, against the need for structured data to assist with computability |\n\n7) Facilitate digital and mobile patient engagement  \n- Support synchronous and asynchronous communication with the clinical team \n- Support health promotion and management of chronic disease \n### Way Forward\n\nBased on the above findings, the following six projects are submitted for discussion. This is by no means intended to be an all inclusive of candidate projects that could demonstrate the potential for SHR to address usability challenges in the clinician-patient interaction. \n\n**_1) Natively support USPSTF Grade A and B and Choosing Wisely recommendations within the SHR**_\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force Grade A and B recommendations detail the preventive health services that uncontroversially apply to all patients [[4](https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/uspstf-a-and-b-recommendations/)]. The Choosing Wisely campaign is a collaboration between all major medical societies. Its recommendations highlight over-utilized services that provide low value to patient care and the health system [[5](http://www.choosingwisely.org/clinician-lists/)]. Taken together, these recommendations represent much of the uncontroversial \"what to do\" and \"what not to do\" elements of care. Since a primary care physician managing an average patient panel size would need to spend 37 hours a week providing all Grade A and B recommended services, without any other clinical activities, automating as much of this process as possible could generate a rapid positive impact for primary care workflow [[6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447803/)].\n\n**_2) Reconfigure data entry to support relationship building, minimize distractions, and be more user-friendly for clinicians and patients**_\nThe data liquidity achieved through implementation of SHR allows for an ecosystem of related services to assist clinicians and patients with documentation. A variety of startups demonstrate some various approaches. Bright.md markets a \"virtual physicians assistant\" that will take a history through a basic online interface and develop a basic treatment plan [[7](http://bright.md/)]. The documentation can then be reviewed and altered by the clinician. Tonic provides accessible, easy to use, web and mobile based questionnaires to assist patients with entering, reviewing and updating the data in their health records [[8](http://www.tonicforhealth.com/)]. Lexenco leverages UMLS Metathesaurus concepts based and an open-source NLP engine to provide SaaS processing of clinical content and association with UMLS concept IDs [[9](http://www.lexenco.com/)]. Each of these individual offerings represents a partial solution to important usability challenges listed above. Leveraging multiple third-party solutions, i.e. these or others, within a clinical environment highlights the \"plug and play\" modularity that SHR empowers, demonstrating short term benefit to clinicians and patients without lengthy development timelines of a bespoke, potentially duplicative technology.\n\n**_3) Support for differential diagnosis**_\nThe differential diagnosis (DDx) is a ranking of the likely explanation for the presenting signs and symptoms of a given patient. A DDx is most often ranked by probability, although it may also be ranked by disease severity (i.e. prognosis) or ease of treatment (i.e. pragmatism). The discipline of compiling and reviewing a DDx underlies much of the expert thinking in medicine. Computer systems are adept at generating probability-weighted lists. An implementation of SHR could assist with compiling a DDx and integrating it within the clinical workflow, as a form of CDS. Technology developed by Inferscience is relevant to this objective [[10](http://www.inferscience.com/)].\n\n**_4) Solving the Usability Challenges of Non-Physician Health Care Workers**_\nThis is included as a placeholder. Susan and I agree that this is very important; however it may be out of scope as a primary focus for Jay Schnitzer's request to address clinician-patient usability.\n\n**_5) Assessing and Addressing Social Determinants of Health within the Clinical Encounter**_\nPlaceholder for now. \n\n**_6) SMS-based platform for asynchronous communication with the care team**_\n Eva is an NLP-powered algorithm with access to the EHR and practice management software. She records her conversation with the patient within the EHR. Eva can report or collect structured data observations to or from the patient. When she does not know an answer, she triggers a medical assistant, triage nurse, or scheduler to call the patient, depending upon the issue. She can address most of the common reasons for calling the physician office, e.g. scheduling appointments, obtaining recent lab results, requesting updated referrals or medication refills, without a human-in-the-loop, and quickly trigger the appropriate human when necessary.\n",

I also wanted to clarify why I did the things and improvements this way. The document will be updated randomly when new ideas appear.\r\n\r\n### HTTP or sockets -> native messaging\r\nWhen a browser extension starts a process using native messaging first it loads a JSON config file that holds the path to the binary file and a list of allowed browser extensions. So when comparing this to the plain passifox/chromeipass and KeePassHTTP it much more secure. To gain access to your database or the KeePassXC process a malicous browser extension will not be accepted and native messaging returns an error. To \"hack\" the connection between native messaging browser extension and KeePassXC you'd need a rogue application that must change the JSON file content **and** provide an incorrect or malformed version of the KeePassXC itself. The downside is that the KeePassXC-Browser extension basically controls the KeePassXC process and it cannot be started beforehand or the connection fails. In short, it's pretty secure after all.\r\n\r\n### Proxy application support\r\nThis new browser intergration also supports Unix domain sockets (named pipes under Windows) that could handle any messages between KeePassXC-Browser and KeePassXC with the keepassxc-proxy application. This method is much safer than the original KeePassHTTP provides.  When using a proxy application through Unix domain sockets or the old KeePassHTTP method it's of course possible that a malicious application captures your keys and acts like a \"verified\" client. Currently there's no safe method to ensure if the client is valid without any extra user interaction. Still, libsodium provides a slightly better encryption so the connection doesn't rely on just one base64 encoded key that's visible in packet capture.. Instead it uses a keypair where only public keys are transferred but you need the secret key(s) to encrypt or decrypt the data.\r\n\r\n### Other improvements\r\nThe version 0.3.4 added a feature that you can lock the database from the popup without needing to go back to KeePassXC. With 0.3.5 the database states are received from KeePassXC instead of polling the state continously.\r\n\r\nThe previous versions (including the original passifox/chromeipass) didn't update the active tab credentials even when there were changes with the databases. This means that if your database has locked because of a timeout or you have switched to another database tab the active tab/page still holds valid credentials in the memory from the previously active database. This is no good. Now the credentials will be cleared if the database is locked or switched to a locked one. Also, if you have two databases open the credentials are received automatically from the active database even if you switch from one to another. All this happens without needing to reload the page.",

      "body": "I would like us to consider removing all references to PGP and GPG, because it's my belief that if it weren't so famous and longstanding, we would reject it from the list today. For further clarification, I am talking about PGP in the context of email.\r\n\r\nMaterials on PGP's suckiness abound, but here's an incomplete list just off the top of my head (in rough order of how terrible they are):\r\n\r\n1. PGP leaks metadata like a champion, including the subject line and recipients\r\n2. Outdated crypto, no forward secrecy, big keys\r\n3. Fingerprint verification is really hard to explain\r\n4. Super easy to fuck up _basic_ UX stuff, like e.g. not encrypting to yourself so you can't read your sent mail\r\n5. Most if not all PGP UIs are terrible, it's really easy to accidentally turn off encryption\r\n6. Revocation isn't reliable\r\n7. Even if you do set up refreshes to get revocation you leak your entire social graph to the keyserver, and often keyservers literally speak plaintext so you can sniff this stuff completely passively (unless you use parcimonie but that doesn't come set up by default, _anywhere_ AFAIK, and no one knows about it so it's worthless)\r\n8. There's no real multi-device experience, particularly for your own trust decisions\r\n9. Trust in the Web of Trust is completely broken because you have no idea what security steps _other_ people take, which is a big problem because you're relying on other people's signatures (and therefore security) to compute trust paths; see also https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/030235.html\r\n\r\nI could go on and on but I'll stop there. https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/08/13/whats-matter-with-pgp/ goes into a lot of these points too.\r\n\r\nThere are better alternatives. I have [tried to teach PGP](https://strugee.net/cryptoparty-seattle/) in the real world and both times it has gone exceedingly poorly to the point where I abandoned it entirely and taught Signal instead. Keysigning parties are a joke; they're _somewhat_ useful in very small contexts/communities like Debian but not at scale.\r\n\r\nI will also point out that a lot of these problems can be fixed. But by the time you fix them, you'll end up with a brand-new backwards-incompatible protocol that basically reimplements Signal, only poorly. And some cannot be fixed at all really, like the metadata problem.",

Ideally these would sync their message history when both of them are online, and any messages sent to me and replies I send back would be delivered to all devices.\n\nThe current Ricochet ID format is ricochet:ID. To take multiple devices into account, you could expand this by doing something like:\n\nricochet:device1,device2,device3\n\nThis would of course make the IDs longer, but as they're not intended to be human-readable I'm not sure that's a major issue.\n\nFor existing contacts, you would then need to send them the new ID the next time you communicate with them so that messages get sent to each device.\n\nI'm not sure what the best UI flow for adding new devices would be. Something involving a BIG DAMN WARNING that all messages sent from this device would be readable by the others.\n",

Lets say you are getting a Signal message on your mobile. You select the notification message, switching to your Signal app, opening the conversation. You now see the last part of the conversation dialogue between you and this single person. You now answer the message of that person, writing things that are meant to be read only by that single person. Just after sending the message (or never?) you realize that you just sent this message to a group chat of many people whose conversation happens to be filled with messages of you and the other person as long as your screen view/history is showing.\r\n\r\nTherefore, you accidentally sent a personal message to a group conversation which is a common bug I notice many times.\r\n\r\nYou assumed, that you wrote your message in a private conversation because you have seen only one person's answers. Other people did not write for a longer period of time to that group conversation. You could have read the header information where you could have seen that this is not a person-to-person conversation. However, you concentrate on the bottom of the screen, where the received message could be seen and answer right below it. Therefore, it is easy to overlook the group chat header when answering a message in Signal. There is no other distinction between group and personal conversations.\r\n\r\n(This bug was issues before as https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7158 and got closed due to spring cleaning and a changed template)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThe situation in a private chat:\r\n\r\n- switch to a person-to-person conversation with person X\r\n- you see the most recent chat messages of X and yourself\r\n- you can answer right away and the message get sent to X\r\n\r\nNow the situation in a group chat:\r\n\r\n- now switch to a group conversation where X is part of as well\r\n- the most recent messages are only from you and X\r\n- it is easy to assume that this is a private chat between you and X: you only see messages from X and yourself, the lower part of the screen looks the same in group chats and in private chats:\r\n  - input field\r\n  - default text hint\r\n  - send button\r\n  - style\r\n- As a result, private text messages get sent to a group chat\r\n\r\n**Actual result:** Private message get sent to a group of people.\r\n**Expected result:** User should have recognized that the message is about to be sent to a group of people and not to a private chat.\r\n\r\nFor a messaging app that emphasizes the importance of privacy, sending sensitive private information to a group of people by accident is considered an important issue IMO. Since there are easy to implement technical solutions to prevent this (see below), this is considered a bug and not a feature request.\r\n\r\n### Device info\r\n<!-- replace the examples with your info -->\r\n**Device:** OnePlus 5\r\n**Android version:** 8.0.0\r\n**Signal version:** 4.17.5\r\n\r\n### Possible mitigations\r\n\r\nThere are multiple possible ways to fix this issue. A distinct background color is one which seemed to be a low-hanging fruit in terms of quick-fix because this features exists in the personal conversation settings and not in the group conversation settings for no obvious reason. However, there is still the issue that Signal might give away \"red\" for an arbitrary personal conversation but this only leads to you looking more closely to the header, realizing that it is save to write personal stuff in this conversation.\r\n\r\nChanging the \"Signal message\" default text of the input line would be another possibility although in my opinion, this is too subtle. I don't think that users do read this default text any more. Things like that is likely to be ignored just like banner ads are being ignored easily despite their prominent use of color or animation.\r\n\r\nI do think that changing the send-button to something like a send button that graphically includes multiple smaller send buttons or multiple of those paper-plane-symbols would be a very good distinction. IMHO this would be easy to notice and easy to explain: multiple paper-plane symbols reflect multiple messages that are sent out to multiple Signal clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This reduces the technical complexity a lot, and reduces user confusion: Each user will have only one public key to share with his friends.\n\n**_How it works**_:\n\n**Linking the devices (Sharing the identity):**\nAlice already has an identity - which is a public/private key pair - on her PC, Alice decides to use her smartphone with Tox. Alice clicks a \"Add an existing identity\" button on the smartphone. Alice then inputs her public key. In the background, Alice's smartphone creates a temporarily identity and contacts Alice's PC via DHT. It then sends a \"linking request\", Alice accepts that request on her PC (We could make her type a secret phrase on both ends for security). Once the request is accepted, the Private/Public key pair is transferred - securely, either via DHT or p2p - from Alice's PC to Alice's smartphone. Alice's smartphone discards the temporarily identity and adopts the newly received one.\nAlice's smartphone then \"goes online\", see next section.\n\n**When a device goes online - Cooperation between devices sharing the same key:**\nWhen a devices starts up / finishes the step above, it checks if another device is already online with the same public key (Scanning the DHT possibly requires a temporarily identity, correct me here). 2 Things can occur:\n\n_A: There is a device already online with that same public key:_\nWe'll call the device which is already online the \"master\" (the PC in Alice's case).\nWe'll call the newly connecting device a \"slave\" (the smartphone in Alice's case).\n\nThe slave contacts the master via DHT (via a temporarily identity), and asks to be synced. The slave can easily prove it has possession of the same private key as the master by completing a challenge. Once this is proven, the master and the slave sync up: The slave(Smartphone) initiates a peer-to-peer connection to the master(PC), it then **opts out of the DHT**. Now, the phone is merely a \"remote interface\" to the PC, which is the actual Tox peer: Any action Alice performs on the slave(smartphone) is sent to the master (PC), only the master contacts the DHT and/or Alice's friends. Any action the PC receives from the DHT/from alice's friends is sent to the smartphone.\n\nTo sum it up, the slave is a \"remote session\" of the master.\n\n_B: There is no device already online with that same public key:_\nIn that case, the newly connecting devices connects normally using the normal Tox procedure, no science here. The devices then becomes the \"master\".\n\n**Some remarks:**\n1. This also works with multiple slaves. The master should randomly choose a \"top slave\" among all the connected slaves, in case the master disconnects, the \"top slave\" becomes the master and the remaining slaves reconnect to their new master. \n2. The linking phase is really easy and already partially implemented: It is very similar to accepting a friend request.\n3. The entire procedure can be implemented via a client and does not require changes to the Tox network protocol. (But it's best to implement in Tox Core)\n",

Attach a screenshot if possible.\r\n\r\nWire consumes a lot of processing resources sitting idle doing nothing. This is a problem that I filed before, and is made worse when timed messages are present. For me it's to the point of choosing to quit wire because it's killing the laptop battery, or run wire and let it kill the laptop battery and so not be able to run anything.\r\n\r\nObviously this is not a good choice and you have some significant design issues to overcome.\r\n\r\nThis situation should never happen as shown below where there are no messages and Wire is consuming significant power resources. Even if there are timed messages, idle apps should not suck processor. Running timers is not significantly CPU draining if they are implemented correctly. If you implement them poorly they can suck a lot of power and cycles which is what seems to be the case.\r\n\r\nInstall iStat Menus in order to track processor usage and get battery drain reports.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"248\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-10-20 at 15 49 28\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5317653/31839670-23acd574-b5b0-11e7-8f2a-5908ee6a6e07.png\">\r\n<img width=\"757\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-10-20 at 15 49 35\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5317653/31839671-23c58452-b5b0-11e7-84c8-d2c5617a2018.png\">\r\n",

If there are multiple IdP IDs for a UserID, how should this be handled? Possible solution: Store a list of IdP IDs for each UserID. Restrict the user to one IdP ID per CSP/UserID.\n\n3.)

      "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI found this source code confusingly written (and downright scary at times) and the [specification](https://toktok.github.io/spec) woefully underspecified and inexplicit, so it's entirely possible my understanding of the handshake is _inaccurate_. But on the off-chance that 5 minutes of source code review at 4am yielded something accurate, here is my understanding of the handshake:\r\n\r\nPeer A (Alice) has the longterm static keypair `(S_A^{pub}, S_A^{priv})`. Peer A has the session-generated ephemeral keypair `(E_A^{pub}, E_A^{priv})`. Peer B (Bob) has the longterm static keypair `(S_B^{pub}, S_B^{priv})`. Peer B has the session-generated ephemeral keypair `(E_B^{pub}, E_B^{priv})`.\r\n\r\nMessage 1: A -> B\r\n```\r\nXAEAD(key=ECDH(S_A^{priv}, S_B^{pub}), payload=E_A^{pub})\r\n```\r\n\r\nMessage 2: B -> A\r\n```\r\nXAEAD(key=ECDH(S_B^{priv}, S_A^{pub}), payload=E_B^{pub})\r\n```\r\n\r\nSession Key Derivation\r\n```\r\nECDH(E_A^{priv}, E_B^{pub}) = ECDH(E_B^{priv}, E_A^{pub})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this an accurate representation of the handshake? If so, keep reading. If not, you may safely stop reading here, close the issue, and accept my apologies for the misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that this naive handshake is vulnerable to key-compromise impersonation, something that basically all modern authenticated key exchanges (AKEs) are designed to protect against. Concretely, the issue is that if A's longterm static private key is stolen, an attacker can impersonate anybody to A without A realizing. Let's say that Mallory, M, has stolen A's private key and wants to pretend to be B:\r\n\r\nMessage 1: M -> A\r\n```\r\nXAEAD(key=ECDH(S_A^{priv}, S_B^{pub}), payload=E_M^{pub})\r\n```\r\n\r\nMessage 2: A -> M\r\n```\r\nXAEAD(key=ECDH(S_A^{priv}, S_B^{pub}), payload=E_A^{pub})\r\n```\r\n\r\nSession Key Derivation\r\n```\r\nECDH(E_A^{priv}, E_M^{pub}) = ECDH(E_M^{priv}, E_A^{pub})\r\n```\r\n\r\nA now thinks he is talking to B, but is actually talking to M.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Tox doesn't care about this, or about many of the threat models that modern AKEs are designed to protect against, in which case, probably it's fine to continue using your homebrewed crypto. But if you actually desire some kind of high assurance security, I strongly recommend not building your own protocols and instead use something designed by an educated expert, such as [Noise](http://noiseprotocol.org/).\r\n\r\nThis is just what immediately leaped out at me after a few short minutes of review. I haven't even begun to look at key derivation and other interesting aspects (are you guys really just using raw ECDH results as keys?).\r\n\r\nAgain, apologies if this doesn't actually represent the handshake you're using; I'm not 100% certain. But in case it does, then let this be a wake-up call to developers not to roll your own crypto, as well as a wake-up call to users not to rely on crypto software written by non-experts.",

      "body": "Right now as I understand it, the source uploads a sensitive document, that document is sent over Tor to the hidden service running on the source server, that source server encrypts the document, and it is only decrypted on the SVS. This means that if the source server is somehow compromised, an attacker could recover the plaintext of the document before it is encrypted.\n\nChanneling some of the feedback from Patrick Ball at the techno-activism event tonight, it might make sense to instead encrypt on the client with the public key of the system. That way, if the source server is compromised, the data will still be protected, so long as the SVS is secure. Since the SVS has a higher security model than the source server.\n\nThe way that was suggested to accomplish this is via a browser extension, or baking keys into the browser. In addition to being a lot of work, this brings up the whole can of worms that comes with key distribution (e.g. does the browser extension/patch server as a CA?)\n\nIn the shorter term, one could just provide the public key with Javascript, and encrypt the document using it before sending it to the source server. There are two issues I see with this: first, adding Javascript may open up an attack vector if no Javascript is being used right now. Second, the attacker we've presumed to have control of the source server could modify the Javascript to include a different public key. The second problem I think is solvable with a super basic browser add-on or something that detects when a client sees unexpected Javascript. Not all clients have to run this. Given the attacker does not who has submitted documents, she must attack everyone to attack her target. That means even if a small percentage of people run the testing add-on, it will still make an effective attack (against everyone) detectable.\n\n[There should be a separate bug for if and how to move the conversation with the journalist to use a somewhat similar client-side approach.]\n",

Is there a way to query after user names?

      "body": "Some years back there was a good discussion about this in #1682 .  At the time it was determined that the use-case just wasn't there to make it worthwhile.  What with the proliferation of in-browser web-apps it may be time to reconsider.  As an example,  I typically run five to ten different \"applications\" in a web browser that I would like to be addressable from my window manager.   These are things like, email, chat programs, ticketing systems, management tools and more - all of which run inside a browser.   \r\n\r\nTo accomplish this there are a few options:\r\n\r\n1. Run seperate browser instances\r\nThis works - especially when coupled with something like electron and nativefier where each instance can have its own name and properties.  The trouble is that each of these instances is a huge resource hog.   Running more than six or seven of these at the same time will bring a quad-core system with 16g of RAM to its knees.   This makes it not really feasable at any sort of scale.\r\n\r\n2) Attempt to address the individual applications by their `title` properties.  \r\nThis also works -  most of the time.  Unfortunately, the usability of this entirely depends on the websites you are using.  Browsers typically modify the window title based on the page you are on.  Some web pages, like google inbox, will maintain a fairly consistent set of window titles, while others, like the AWS console, don't.   This makes addressing based on `title` error-prone at best and broken at worst.   \r\n\r\nI know that in the past the opinion has been that the application author needs to fix their application, and that being unable to use class, title, instance or other window properties is a broken behavior.   However, I think that since the landscape has changed in the direction that it has, and since we are using the same \"binary\" (web browser) to access multiple \"applications\" (web pages) it may be beneficial to provide some funcationality for this use-case.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Thanks!\r\n\r\n  ",

Otherwise it'll never get a significant market share with the average users.\nBut we also want to provide maximum security for people who depend on it with their lives, maybe because they live in an undemocratic country and have an unpopular opinion, maybe because they are protesting the regime in Syria, maybe they are gay and happen to live in Uganda or any of the other 82 coutries where that can get you in jail or even executed.\n\nAs TextSecure is supposed to be secure **and** user friendly there are going to be more and more cases where we will have to decide on a default behaviour, often between the safer and the more convenient option.\nMany of the convenient features, which many users want, because they know and love them from W**_sapp, F_book and other less privacy/security focused apps and plattforms leak data, which, in some really bad cases, could lead to people getting hurt or worse.\n\nAn example would be a notification popup with the message content like #798 requests. In some cases even mentioning the sender alone can be a threat (#308 and #366).\nIt gets really bad if this can even happen on a locked phone (#198).\n\nIf we neither want to force the average user to go deep into the advanced settings to manually activate all the features they expect (really bad usability) nor want to endanger some users by choosing insecure but convenient defaults, we should ask the user at the setup level what their use case is:\n- casual user\n- moderately security concious user\n- tinfoilhat™ / protester in $nodemocracyhere \n\nBased on their choice we'll set default settings for the above mentioned features, as well as security features like #175, #226 and #328 and future convenience features.\n\nIt should also be possible to re-run this from the advanced settings.\n\nOne of the most important presets for the paranoid mode would be to turn off SMS messages entirely, because the metadata, which is the most important tool in modern surveillance, can't be hidden. The network providers can also easily scan the traffic and find out who uses TS, which will put people at risk.\n\nWith data that problem doesn't exist, because the relay (GCM) probably isn't controlled by the \"enemy\" and it works like an anonymizing proxy, because lots of normal apps use GCM.\nAs long as HTTPS (TLS) isn't broken (again...), data should be safe.\n",

Suffer from a huge sticker panel.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**: Just noticed already reported and marked as \"invalid\". This is not obvious way to disable panel. Either should be signaled better or put into general settings as well.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nThere should be option to disable that behavior of sticker panel, as not everyone uses them in the first place.\r\n**Update**: This option should be:\r\n1. Better signalled to user, as expecting him to magically know that clicking the small \"smile\" icon will revert behavior to default is bad idea.\r\n2. Be in the general settings, as that's the first place where user would search for a way to disable panel.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nThere is no way of disabling sticker panel other than making window smaller.\r\n**Update**: There is way to disable it, but it is completely not obvious.\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n**Operating system:** Windows 7 Ultimate\r\n\r\n**Version of Telegram Desktop:** 1.1\r\n\r\n**Used theme**: Recolored to dark default.",

      "body": "So I have had a look at BitTorrent sync, syncthing and alternatives and what I always wondered about was the possibility to not only sync between resources I own and trust, but also external resources/servers which I do NOT trust with my data, up to a certain extent.\n\nOne way to do this is using ecryptfs or encfs, but this has many obvious downsides: it is not an interoperable solution (only works on Linux), the files are actually stored in encrypted form on the disk (even if the resource is trusted and this is not necessary, for instance because of the file system being encrypted already), etc.\n\nWhat I propose is somehow configuring nodes which are only sent the files in an encrypted format, with all file contents (and potentially file/directory names as well; or even permissions) being encrypted. This way, if I want to store my private files on a fast server in a datacenter to access them from anywhere, I could do this with syncthing without essentially giving up ownership of those files. I could also prevent that particular sync node from being allowed/able to make any changes to the files without me noticing.\n\nI realize that this requires a LOT of additional effort, but it would be a killer feature that seems to not be available in any other \"private cloud\" solution so far. What are your thoughts on this feature?\n\nEDIT: BitTorrent sync mentions a feature like this in their API docs: \"Encryption secret\nAPI users can generate folder secrets with encrypted peer support. Encryption secrets are read-only. They make Sync data encrypted on the receiver’s side. Recipients can sync files, but they can’t see file content, and they can’t modify the files. Encryption secrets come in handy if you need to sync to an untrusted location.\" (from http://www.bittorrent.com/intl/de/sync/developers/api)\n",

      "body": "Per the [Milestones schedule](https://github.com/kee-org/browser-addon/milestones) on this repository, the bulk of all efforts until the release of version 2.0 will be on ensuring that we can get something vaguely resembling KeeFox 1.6 to run in Firefox 57+ (and Google Chrome, etc.)\r\n\r\nThat means re-writing the add-on to use [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/What_are_WebExtensions).\r\n\r\nI've made a good start by pulling over some code snippets from KeeFox 1.6 and piecing them together in a way that has resulted in the current \"pre-alpha\" version having the following broadly working:\r\n\r\n- Basic add-on architecture (build, default config, logging to console)\r\n- Connection from add-on to the existing KeePassRPC plugin version\r\n- Rendering state of connection on a browser button/icon on the browser toolbar\r\n- Detection of forms on web pages\r\n- Sending request to find matching logins and receiving list of logins in the web page\r\n\r\nThe lists below will be expanded as we delve into more detail and see how the WebExtensions API evolves over the next 6 months. With some luck we might be able to implement some items from the \"uncertain\" list although it's also likely other features will be added to the two lists.\r\n\r\n### Functionality we are unable to retain\r\n\r\n- Assisted KeePass installation and configuration (prohibited by WebExtensions)\r\n- Some customised keyboard shortcut keys (it should be possible for each user to manually re-configure them though)\r\n- Logging to files (prohibited by WebExtensions)\r\n- Protecting the KeePassRPC authentication token with the Firefox master password (prohibited by WebExtensions)\r\n\r\n### Functionality we are unlikely to retain (either too much work or uncertain technical viability)\r\n\r\n- Some customised keyboard shortcut keys (we probably won't migrate the current settings but some keyboard shortcuts that relate to specific web pages can be supported if we have time)\r\n- Launching KeePass from within Firefox (launching executables is banned although if a user were to install a hypothetical \"KeeFox helper\" executable we might be able to get something to work but it is unlikely that will exist on most user's systems so this work goes to the bottom of the priority list)\r\n- Multi-page logins (the code that will deal with filling and saving passwords gets created and destroyed on every page load, making this a technically difficult problem to solve)\r\n- Some assistive UI (e.g. new user advice, tips, security warnings). Things like \"Save/update password?\" should be possible in some form but may suffer from reduced usability\r\n- Usage metrics (this is useful for planning how to improve KeeFox but with limited control over the changes we are making for version 2.0, a reduction in the number of platforms running version 2.0 and a lack of time to analyse and act on the limited data we could collect, it's not worthwhile initially)\r\n- HTTP Auth/Proxy/Windows Auth dialog box filling and saving (not possible to modify the dialog box, other more-limited approaches could work if we have time though)\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to comment or ask questions below. I'll try to reply regularly but hope you'll understand that my priority is developing the code rather than answering questions that have already been answered multiple times. If you can help answer anyone else's questions or get involved in other discussion threads that would be great.",

      "body": "# `DOMChangeList` and `DOMTreeConstruction`\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThere are three high-level motivations for this API:\r\n1. To make it clearer and less error prone to apply a sequence of DOM operations at once, that can support the full gamut of mutations to `Element`s and `Node`s.\r\n2. For efficiency, to provide an API for constructing a sequence of DOM operations that can be:\r\n   1. constructed in a worker and transferred to the UI thread\r\n   2. constructed with a minimum of allocations\r\n   3. applied in one shot without interleaved user code\r\n3. To support, in one API, the superset of trees that can be produced using the HTML parser and using the DOM API (the HTML parser supports more tag names, while the DOM API supports more trees, such as custom elements nested inside a table).\r\n\r\n> This is an initial, minimal version of this API, which could be expanded over time with more capabilities. It should always maintain its goals of predictable, allocation-lite performance, focusing on giving user-space abstractions the capabilities they need for maximum performance.\r\n# Concepts\r\n## NodeToken\r\n\r\nA `NodeToken` is an opaque value that represents a `Node`. It can be efficiently transferred from one worker to another.\r\n\r\nIt serves two purposes:\r\n- To represent a `Node` that already exists in another worker, and can serve as the starting point of a series of mutations expressed in a `DOMChangeList`.\r\n- To represent an intermediate `Node` that was produced as part of the process of building a `DOMChangeList`.\r\n## Applying a Change\r\n\r\nThe intent of this API is to have these performance characteristics:\r\n- Creating a change list (`DOMTreeConstruction` or `DOMChangeList`) significantly reduces GC-managed allocations compared to the current DOM APIs.\r\n- Applying a change list should not create intermediate JavaScript wrappers for the DOM objects it creates, which should reduce costs.\r\n- It is possible to run the JavaScript code necessary to construct a change list in a worker, and apply it on the UI thread with minimal additional work or allocations in JavaScript.\r\n- The API creates a single immutable blob of instructions to pass to the engine, which is intended to avoid JavaScript side effects while the application proceeds. (as [Boris Zbarsky said](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11780060) in his comment about proposals in this space, \"that would simplify both specification and implementation (in the sense of not having to spell out a specific processing algorithm, allowing parallelized implementation, etc).\")\r\n- It is reasonable to assume that the builder APIs could be exposed to WebAssembly.\r\n\r\nIf there is some reason that a concrete implementation of this design might not be able to accomplish these goals, it's almost certainly something we should discuss.\r\n# Details\r\n## DOMTreeConstruction\r\n\r\n> Note: Use of TypeScript generics notation in the details of this proposal does not intend to imply any additional type checking. It is simply a way to annotate which kinds of node a particular node tokens is intended to produce for clarity. This proposal expects checking at the point of application (e.g. appending a node to a non-element node doesn't make sense and would be an error at the time of application). At present, this proposal does not assume that errors in the change list cause previously applied operations to be rolled back; that is listed as an open question below.\r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\n// you can create a NodeToken in the UI thread and transfer it into\r\n// a worker that constructs the DOMChangeList or DOMTreeConstruction.\r\npartial interface Node {\r\n  getToken(): NodeToken<this>;  \r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Bounds {\r\n  firstNode: NodeToken<Node>;\r\n  lastNode: NodeToken<Node>;\r\n}\r\n\r\npartial interface Element {\r\n  // this has the same semantics as insertBefore, but takes a `DOMTreeConstruction`\r\n  insertTreeBefore(element: Element, tree: DOMTreeConstruction, reference: Node): Promise<AppliedChanges>;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// The intent of this object is to allow engines to clean up any bookkeeping maps they\r\n// need to track `NodeToken`s once the `AppliedChanges` is GCed.\r\ninterface AppliedChanges {\r\n  // this allows code that created a ChangeList to get the actual\r\n  // node they were creating so they can add listeners or change\r\n  // the node later.\r\n  getNode<T extends Node>(t: NodeToken<T>): T;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// DOMTreeConstruction is transferrable, and is backed by raw bytes.

Don't you still have to create all of the DOM nodes anyway? If so, why is it cheaper?\r\n2. Isn't DOM pretty fast in modern browsers already?\r\n\r\nThe intent of this API is to create a low-level interface that is as close as possible to the underlying implementations. It attempts to avoid introducing new costs while reducing a number of paper-cuts that exist in today's usage.\r\n1. This API creates DOM nodes in the engine, but it does not need to create JavaScript wrappers. Experiments with deep `cloneNode` show that skipping those wrappers provides a performance benefit, but `cloneNode()` can't satisfy as many use-cases as this API.\r\n2. It allows the construction of the set of mutations to occur separately from the application (or even in a worker), keeping the sensitive work that limits 60fps to a minimum.\r\n3. Since applying changes is asynchronous, the full change list can be applied in batches that avoid blocking interaction (especially scroll). If the browser reaches its budget, it can interleave some work to keep the UI interactive and pick up the mutation process afterward. In short, the API should allow browsers to experiment with more scheduling strategies.\r\n4. It encourages good staging practices, eliminating some of the major causes of layout thrash (see the next section).\r\n### Isn't the real issue that people are interleaving DOM manipulation and layout?\r\n\r\nThat is certainly a major issue, and this API puts developers on the path to success by encouraging them to stage DOM manipulation work separately from APIs that can trigger painting or layout.\r\n\r\nBecause the API guarantees that no user script can interleave during the application of changes, there is no way to \"mess up\" and trigger an immediate flush of any deferred work.\r\n# Unresolved Questions\r\n1. The current state of this API allows failures to occur during the processing of a change list, and does not require engines to roll back earlier changes (rolling back changes like \"remove an iframe\" may not be trivial to implement). Would engines prefer to roll back changes?\r\n2. Should we support APIs like `ClassList` and the `style` property through this API? It may be difficult to represent these kinds of changes with the operations already proposed (since this API does not allow direct imperative access to the DOM), and a few additional APIs probably wouldn't do damage to the constraints.\r\n3. Are there other optimizations that could be performed by engines? For example, Luke Wagner suggested that a parameterized version of this API could work like \"prepared statements\" in SQL, allowing engines to do up-front work to optimize the access and mutation patterns for application. What can we do to make this API more hospitable to hypothetical optimizations like those?\r\n",

The plugins menu should then probably be sorted alphabetically. And it should have both registered sidebars as registered screens.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI've created a PR on Yoast SEO to test this with. https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/pull/8531 shows how the API can be used.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (jpeg or gifs if applicable):\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-12-20 at 13 25 25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/584693/34207091-44b38052-e589-11e7-9982-d57a2131f00a.png)\r\n![screen shot 2017-12-20 at 13 25 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/584693/34207075-356ed72c-e589-11e7-9c1c-5033a42f1a37.png)\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n* New API.\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code is tested.\r\n- [x] My code follows the WordPress code style.\r\n- [x] My code follows has proper inline documentation.",

      "body": "- **WP4:** [User Interfaces](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/tree/master/WP4)\r\n- **Lead Institution:** Université Paris-Sud\r\n- **Due:** 2016-08-31 (month 12)\r\n- **Nature:** Demonstrator\r\n- **Tasks:** T4.1 (#69): Uniform notebook interface for all interactive components, T4.6 (#74) Structured documents\r\n- **Proposal:** [p. 48](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/raw/master/Proposal/proposal-www.pdf)\r\n- **[Final report](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/raw/master/WP4/D4.5/report-final.pdf)**\r\n\r\nThe [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) is a web application that enables the creation and sharing of executable documents which contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Thanks to a modular design, Jupyter can be used with any computational system that provides a so-called [_Jupyter kernel_](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/kernels.html) implementing the [_Jupyter messaging protocol_](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to communicate with the notebook. OpenDreamKit therefore promotes the Jupyter notebook as user interface of choice, in particular since it is particularly suitable for building modular web based Virtual Research Environments.\r\n\r\nA notebook interface is such a vital integrative component that, predating Jupyter, the open source mathematical system SageMath had developed as early as 2005 its own solution, which we refer to here as the legacy SageMath notebook. Development was fast tracked to ensure its availability to allow the project to move forward, and it served as major source of inspiration for Jupyter.  Meanwhile, moving at a fast pace thanks to its much larger community, Jupyter had, by 2014, basically caught up with the legacy SageMath notebook in terms of functionality. \r\n\r\nBuilding on top of D4.4 (#93): Basic Jupyter interface for GAP, PARI/GP, SageMath, Singular, the goal of this deliverable was therefore to help phase out the legacy SageMath notebook in favour of Jupyter. Outsourcing this key but non disciplinary component is an important step toward the sustainability of ODK's ecosystem (Objective 5).\r\n\r\nSince 2014, a lot of work was put into this by the SageMath community, and in particular by Volker Braun. Recently, this work has been continued thanks to ODK. It included two aspects: ensuring that Jupyter included all important features of the legacy SageMath notebook, and enabling a smooth migration path for users:\r\n- [x] [#20690](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20690), [#22458](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22458): Live documentation @fcayre, @nthiery, @videlec \r\n- [ ] Interacts/widgets: full support and backward compatibility with the legacy SageNB [#21267](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21267) (closed installation issues: [#21260](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21260) [#21261](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21261) [#20218](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20218) [#21256](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21256)) @jdemeyer\r\n- [x] [#19877](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19877): Conversion of legacy notebooks to Jupyter notebooks @vbraun, @videlec, @marcinofulus\r\n- [x] [#19740](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19740): Migration wizard, as a web application\r\n\r\nFuture work:\r\n- [ ] WYSIWYG editor for the markdown cells, such as [TinyMCE](https://www.tinymce.com/) (see [this post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/t11JSxxCgpw/BR0Bt638AgAJ) for motivation)\r\n- [ ] [#20316](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20316): Add button to export SageNB notebooks to Jupyter\r\n- [ ] \"Search help\" box\r\n- [ ] [Custom menus](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22888) (e.g. for setting options like %display latex, automatic vars, enable/disable preparser; possibly menus to insert typical commands as in SMC)",

In Babel 6, and 7 up to present, the default has been `module`. I also want to make clear that you can still _easily_ set `sourceType:module` in your Babel config to keep the current behavior, but the important question here is the default, because it influences many other parts of Babel's transformations.\r\n\r\nThere are a few primary issues surrounding using `module` as the default:\r\n\r\n* Many perfectly valid Script files will fail to parse. This means that users attempting to run Babel on things in node_modules for instance will fail to parse.\r\n* Defaulting to `module` means Babel converts top-level `this` to `undefined` and injects `use strict`, which can break when run against arbitrary files\r\n* When performing transformations, Babel needs to know whether to inject `import` or `require`, and it does so based on the `sourceType`. Defaulting to `module` means we may inject `import` into valid `CommonJS` modules, breaking them.\r\n* When writing files to disk with `babel-cli` we'd ideally add `.mjs` to files that are modules, and `.js` to scripts. If we default to `module` then we'd potentially output `.mjs` extensions on CommonJS files.\r\n\r\nThese issues become more problematic when you consider that people are more frequently running Babel across arbitrary `node_modules` dependencies. Realistically this pattern is only going to increase in frequency for forseeable future.\r\n\r\nNode now follows this same pattern, with `.js` meaning CommonJS and `.mjs` meaning ESM. There is potential for a field to land in `package.json` that would allow toggling this behavior, and once that lands we could for instance consider a `sourceType: packageMode` option or something, but even with that the default in Node will remain `.js` for CommonJS.\r\n\r\nGiven all of this, it seems like it would be in the best interest of Babel to follow that same pattern, by requiring users to either use `.mjs` or opt into specific ESM behavior in their Babel configuration.\r\n",

Do you know if they are related? I have tested a 40mm single wall cube with no infill, then cut it with scissors. Within a single wall on a single later, I have found my extrusion width getting wider/narrower (and only one extrusion command in the gcode for the entire wall). I also confirmed that where it becomes fatter happens on both the outside and the inside of the print, so this doesn't seem to be X/Y related.\r\n\r\nMany people on the forums are also seeing the same thing, here's some of the images. Looking at it straight on, the prints look fine and Z height seems to be fine. When you shine light down from above, the fatter lines cast shadows and it looks pretty rough.\r\n\r\n**EDIT: Please read before posting!**\r\n\r\nWe appreciate all the help everyone is adding to this post; however, many people are making suggestions without reading the megathread that is this issue. Here's what we _think_ we have squared away thus far. I will continue updating this as I read through the megathread again:\r\n\r\n**First and foremost, Prusa is seeing this on their in-house printers as well and have yet to find a fix.

      "body": "### Status Hackathon Submission\r\n<!-- Fill this out as best as you can now to RSVP. You can always come back and edit it when info changes. -->\r\n<!-- You *don't* need to delete all the comments like this one since they won't show up in the viewer. -->\r\n<!-- Use your project name as the title of this issue. What we should call you when you win? -->\r\nType: DApp / Bot \r\nGithub Repo: https://github.com/Nielsvdiermen/WhoPays\r\nVideo: https://vimeo.com/221149759\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\nWhoPays is a bot made for the status Hackathon. It is an Ethereum blockchain decentralized payment solution for managing and solving expenses for groups of people. If you are on holiday, planning a project or living together you can make a list with everyone and add expenses. When you want to calculate the balance of everyone, the contract will do that for you. It will inform who still has to pay and who receives money. After everyone has paid, the contract will pay out to the people still owing money and the list will be closed.\r\n \r\nA video of how it works can be found here: https://vimeo.com/221149759\r\n \r\n**Starting Design Description:**\r\nA contract-based bot to create groups in which users can keep track of their payments for a group through commands with a new chatbot.\r\n \r\nUse cases:\r\n- When people go on vacation with a group of people and everybody pays some parts of the vacation (dinner, going out, events)\r\n- A group of people living together where individuals buy groceries for the whole group\r\n- You’re planning an event (lets say bachelor party!) and the friends who you’re organizing it with have multiple different expenses e.g. gas usage, food, drinks.\r\n \r\nIn essence it is a simple way for friends to keep track of who paid what during a trip, holiday or other period of time. \r\n \r\nUsers can add and resolve payments through status commands which get send to a contract on the blockchain.  At the end of a duration when the contract needs to be resolved the creator can use a command to close the contract. The contract will calculate how much each user has to pay or receive. The contract will let the Status app know how much each user has to pay and can create Ether requests for this. When everyone has added their payments to the contract, the contract will send Ether to the users who still have to receive some. After that the contract is resolved.\r\n\r\n**What we would like to improve:**\r\nWorking with Status was difficult at times because the app is still quite new and is still being developed on multiple fronts. One of the biggest things we would like to improve in our project to really reach its full potential is the ability to simply add users to a list by selecting them in the address book. Right now we have to manually input Ether addresses and this is very user-unfriendly. What also is needed is the ability to automatically send messages to people in the list that they have joined the list. Right now users have to copy the contract hash to the other members of the list and manually join the list with the /join command and the hash. \r\n \r\nWhile we really like Status and how it gives many new possibilities in the world of blockchain applications we feel that for this technology to grow there needs to a better link  between cryptocurrency and “real” money. For WhoPays everything is Ether based so the user has to calculate how much Ether he/she has paid. A way to calculate between the currencies and automatically calculate it into the current Ether amount would be very welcome.\r\n\r\nWe would have loved to make the bot available in a group chat, so that every user can see who paid for what and there would be less traffic. The way this could work is to create a group with the people you want in the list and add the bot to the group. The bot would then create the list by commands and everyone can see what is being paid and what the current expense balance is.\r\n\r\n**Team Members:**\r\nPreferred Name: Timon\r\nGithub Handle: @nomitpi\r\nSlack Username: @pixel\r\n\r\nPreferred Name: Niels\r\nGithub Handle: @nielsvdiermen\r\nSlack Username: @nielsv\r\n\r\n",

Migrates away from the long-standing `prod-specific.yml` vars file, used for providing site-specific variables and optional customizations. The new file is called `group_vars/all/site-specific`. Includes a new dedicated playbook called `securedrop-configure.yml` that interactively prompts for site-specific secrets, validates them via the `validate` role, then writes them to disk, in a non-version-controlled file.\r\n\r\nAdmins who previously filled out the `prod-specific.yml` playbook need not take any special action. The first time the `securedrop-prod.yml` playbook is run after upgrading to 0.4, the old vars file will be automatically copied to the new location, and its contents read from there for the remainder of the playbook.\r\n\r\nAlso updated the docs throughout, to use the new filename where appropriate, and also to reference the new playbook in the install docs. Avoided expanding the validation logic, since we have separate issues for those (e.g. #749).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Scenario 1: upgrades\r\n1. Check out `0.3.12` and fill out the `prod-specific.yml` file with production-like secrets.\r\n2. Provision prod VMs.\r\n3. Check out this feature branch and reprovision the prod VMs.\r\n4. Confirm that the second provisioning run completed successfully (no undefined vars anywhere).\r\n5. Confirm that the `group_vars/all/site-specific` file was created and its values match those in the `prod-specific.yml` file you manually edited previously.\r\n\r\n### Scenario 2: new installs\r\n1. Check out this feature branch, and ensure you have a clean repo (no customizations to `prod-specific.yml`).\r\n2. Hop into the `install_files/ansible-base` directory and run the new configuration playbook: `ansible-playbook securedrop-configure.yml`. \r\n3. Fill out all the prompts, with the same secrets you used in Scenario 1.\r\n4. Confirm no errors with the validation prompts (playbook will fail if errors are found).\r\n5. Confirm values in `group_vars/all/site-specific` are formatted correctly.\r\n6. Confirm you can provision VMs with the new vars file.\r\n\r\n## Deployment\r\n\r\nEnsured that existing Admins will not need to take special action to migrate the vars—the new prod playbook will handle that for them. The big win is for first-time Admins on the initial install: the combination of interactive prompts and built-in variable validation should provide bumpers enough that misconfigurations do not slip in.

To make it easier to follow development, and to provide a clear, coherent \"rallying point\" for this work, this RFC proposes that we declare a *epoch* every two or three years. Epochs are designated by the year in which they occur, and represent a release in which several elements come together:\r\n\r\n- A significant, coherent set of new features and APIs have been stabilized since the previous epoch.\r\n- Error messages and other important aspects of the user experience around these features are fully polished.\r\n- Tooling (IDEs, rustfmt, Clippy, etc) has been updated to work properly with these new features.\r\n- There is a guide to the new features, explaining why they're important and how they should influence the way you write Rust code.\r\n- The book has been updated to cover the new features.\r\n  - Note that this is already [required](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1636) prior to stabilization, but in general these additions are put in an appendix; updating the book itself requires *significant* work, because new features can change the book in deep and cross-cutting ways. We don't block stabilization on that.\r\n- The standard library and other core ecosystem crates have been updated to use the new features as appropriate.\r\n- A new edition of the Rust Cookbook has been prepared, providing an updated set of guidance for which crates to use for various tasks.\r\n\r\nSometimes a feature we want to make available in a new epoch would require backwards-incompatible changes, like introducing a new keyword. In that case, the feature is only available by explicitly opting in to the new epoch. Existing code continues to compile, and crates can freely mix dependencies using different epochs.\r\n\r\n[stability without stagnation]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/10/30/Stability.html\r\n[usual caveats]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1122-language-semver.md\r\n\r\n[Rendered](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2052-epochs.md)\r\n\r\n**Update**: there's a [Request for Explanation podcast episode](https://request-for-explanation.github.io/podcast/ep2-stealing-chickens-on-the-internet/) about this RFC, which is a good way to quickly get up to speed!\r\n\r\n**Edit**: fixed rendered link",

      "body": "Long ago I opened issue #1024 about replacing the red warning bar that suggests that sources disable Javascript with one suggests they set the Tor Browser security slider to High instead. Some progress has been made (#1480), but the more I think about it, the more I wonder if the warning just shouldn't be there at all -- or rather, replaced with something else.\r\n\r\nIt's no question that setting the security slider to High reduces the browser attack surface. But this is just one small piece of advice out of a myriad of other advice we could give, and I don't think it's even the most important. A much more important piece of advice, for example, is \"don't tell anyone that you're a source.\" Or we could tell sources to use Tails or Whonix. Or we could tell them not to use SD from work, and to always use it on a personal computer.\r\n\r\nIn this context, the scary red warning bar that's specifically about Javascript seems a bit arbitrary.\r\n\r\n![screenshot_2017-02-07_11-43-15](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/156128/22708336/b75af25a-ed2a-11e6-950f-df7bf455e01b.png)\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not convinced it's always sound advice -- there are downsides to setting the slider to High, like it makes many websites completely break, which might be confusing and challenging for people. I obviously don't have data on this, but I suspect that most SecureDrop sources use Tor Browser for submitting to SD, and that's it. When this is the case, the only actor in a position to hack the source using a JS-based Tor Browser exploit is the journalist org that's running the SD server, or someone who hacks that server, and that's it. (Disabling JS is more useful for people who use Tor Browser for email services like SIGAINT that they actively use, or are regulars on forums or markets, or run a twitter account.)\r\n\r\nMaybe the red warning bar should be completely removed, and instead that can just be a link in the footer to https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/source.html (or maybe a new documentation page, or maybe one hosted within the SD website to avoid referrer headers) where it describes various tips and tricks for staying secure as a source.",

This is compounded by the fact that initially only very few people on our contact lists would be on ricochet/invisible.im.

New Buffer API was introduced to prevent accidental data leakage and/or DoS (see https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4660). But there are older modules that haven't been updated and might still be vulnerable. Runtime deprecation encourages module authors to update to the new API, and the users to update their dependencies.\r\n2. It is desirable that Buffer be a proper ES6 class that can be extended. However, parts of the deprecated Buffer API (such as creating a Buffer instance without `new`) make it impossible, while other parts (such as construction from a string) make it more complex. It will make things much simpler if the problematic deprecated parts are removed. But they need to be runtime-deprecated first.\r\n",
