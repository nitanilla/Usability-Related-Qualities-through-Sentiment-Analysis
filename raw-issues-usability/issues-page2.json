      "body": "## Introducing Mozilla Chat\n\ntl;dr: Join us at https://chat.mozillafoundation.org/. Native apps available in \"How to Join\" below.\n\nWe've all used many chat clients here at Mozilla. There’s IRC, Skype, Google Chat, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Minigroups, not to mention good old-fashioned email. Each has its own strengths yet all of them combined create a weakness in the organization’s communication, with teams scattered across these services. These tools have a variety of unique features, but there seem to be a common subset of functional and ideological goals that align with those of Mozilla.\n\nAs we search for the right tool, the Engineering and Design teams have been evaluating Mattermost, an open source Slack-alternative–we can all just call it, \"Chat\". We’ve used it for a few months, contributed some code, and worked out the major usability bugs. Now we’d like to invite the rest of the Foundation to try it out and let us know what you think.\n#### Goals of chat software\n- Be open and promote inclusivity\n- Reduce the need for emails\n- Enable access to conversations at any time on any device (not just while online)\n- Offer ability to manage conversations across projects and reduce the need for meetings.\n#### Useful features of Chat\n- Messaging and files\n- Send messages and comments across public, private, and 1:1 channels\n- Personalize notifications\n- Share files and images\n- Archiving and search\n- Search all channels for past messages and comments\n- View recent mentions of your name, username, nickname, and custom search terms\n- Receive messages even if you’re offline\n- Embeddable Gif support\n#### How to join\n\nVisit https://chat.mozillafoundation.org and sign up. (It’s not integrated with any existing accounts, yet.)\n\nYou can keep it in a browser tab, but you might find it more helpful to download a native app:\n1. Download for your platform\n   - [OSX](https://github.com/mattermost/desktop/releases/download/v1.1.0/mattermost-desktop-1.1.0-osx.tar.gz)\n   - 64-bit [Windows](https://github.com/mattermost/desktop/releases/download/v1.1.0/mattermost-desktop-1.1.0-win64.zip)\n   - Other Desktop releases available [here](https://github.com/mattermost/desktop/releases)\n2. Install/Copy the Mattermost executable to your Applications folder.\n3. If Mac OS gives you an “unsigned developer” warning while opening the app, ctrl-click on the app and click open.\n4. Enter Team: `Mozilla`, URL: `https://chat.mozillafoundation.org`\n5. Create an account or log in.\n\nMobile apps are available for iOS and Android\n\nOnce you're in, you can give feedback in the Mozilla Chat Dev channel.\n#### Notifications:\n\nNotifications can be customized on an account level and a channel level. \n- Account Level: Click the menu icon in the top left corner next to your username and check out “Account Settings”.\n- Channel level: when in a channel, click the name of it at the top and look at notification preferences. You might want to disable unread notifications for certain channels unless you’re specifically mentioned.\n#### Examples\n##### Embedded previews of images- including gifs! ![chat-gif](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1682681/14321423/1beec600-fbe7-11e5-8149-e92290561fba.gif)\n##### Attach files to your conversations! ![chat-attach](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1682681/14464033/41609644-009b-11e6-8fda-531433e88938.gif)\n##### Direct message users from the sidebar or using the /msg command ![chat-dm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1682681/14464051/56188ba0-009b-11e6-8271-3a0052f72170.gif)\n##### Local notifications for mentions, and the ability to mention a whole channel at once (but remember, with great power comes great responsibility) ![chat-mentions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1682681/14464065/612ed3e6-009b-11e6-9b05-c93ff8daa7ec.gif)\n##### Search every conversation you’re a part of at once!

Others, e.g. those with poor eyesight or those with small screens, might find the standard font size too small to read comfortably.\n\nI believe this would be a useful feature and one that's probably pretty straightforward to implement.\n",

      "body": "Hack currently has little/no support for properly checking XHP. It would be really great if we could properly typecheck attribute declarations. Currently, attributes are read/written via `getAttribute('name')` and `setAttribute('name', $val)`. This isn't typeable as-is since the return type of `getAttribute` depends on its name. We have few options here, in order from my preferred to least preferred:\n- Move attributes from an array in the XHP superclasses into an `stdClass`; they would then be accessed through `$this->attributes->name`. We'd add a tiny special case to the typechecker to know what all the fields of `$this->attributes` are. Benefit: changes are pretty minor in XHP superclasses (`stdClass` behaves largely like an array), we can keep the old `getAttribute` methods for backwards compat (and to allow FB www to slowly convert as we get things to typecheck properly), IDE autocomplete just falls out. Downside: I don't see much?\n- Special-case `getAttribute` etc in the typechecker. If we require a constant string as an argument, we can know the type and do the right thing. Benefit: requires no changes to PHP code anywhere. Downside: IDE autocomplete for attributes will have to be more special case code.\n- Move attributes to be protected members directly on the XHP classes. Still need a typechecker special case to convert the `attribute` declaration into members. Benefit: really nice client API -- `$this->attributeName`. Downside: probably impossible to cleanly convert since XHP classes might use attributes with conflicting names, similarly impossible to cleanly enumerate for something like `transferAttributes`.\n\nIt will probably be a few weeks at the earliest before I can get around to any of this, but just wanted to have the issue open for discussion to make sure the approach was good.\n",

It would be nice to see the menu, like when swiping from the left edge.\" _[I agree!]_\n- [x] 3. **Keyboard hiding** - \"on party chat, after I send the message, the keyboard should hide.\" _See also https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg-android/issues/172 \"Keyboard should close when switching view\"_\n- [ ] 4. **Streaks** - \"Please add it so that it shows counts for continuous dailies done in a row!\"\n- [ ] 5. **Mounts for Party** - \"When I go to Party->Members, I don't see mounts.\" (_I've seen that comment two or three times, but it's funny - no one ever comments on the lack of pets or backgrounds._)\n- [ ] 6. **Ticked Dailies not clear enough** - \"One issue is that the visual messaging doesn't seem to be clear when I tick vs. Untick a daily. I installed the app when I already had a number of ticked dailies for the day.\" -- I'm seeking more feedback about this. https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sent/1518f8fc3f3dbcde\n- [ ] 7. **Headings in menu** - could be clearer that they are headings? - \"Inventory is not loading, it's slightly greyed out.\"\n- [ ] 8. **FAB for adding items has usability problems** - \"While looking at my TODOs, I click the bottom-right + icon. I am disappointed that the + icon forces me to again choose a task type instead of creating a TODO (or whatever other task type I am currently browsing). Also, if I mis-tap when aiming for + New Habit, I will edit whatever task is underneath my finger. That seems distracting.\"\n- [ ] 9. **Sound effects** - \"please add the sounds from habitica website... They are now connected in my brain with positive motivation.\"  -- I know this might seem like a minor feature, but that comment about motivation is interesting and valuable. Triggers and rewards are an important part of productivity, and if the sound effects on the website have become integral to your motivation, it would be disappointing to not have them in the app too. I'm thinking this might be a feature we'd want to add sooner rather than later, if it's not too difficult to implement.\n- [ ] 10. **Reminders** - \"multiple reminders through out the day instead of just one reminders for dailies!\"\n- [ ] 11. **Results of completing tasks could be clearer** - \"Better view of the points that get updated and pictures of the Drop items\"\n- [ ] 12. **Ability to move tasks to a different sort order**\n- [ ] 13. **Use slide-down to sync tasks** -- \"have a Task page refresh with a slide down method (like the Party page Chat refresh method)!\"\n- [ ] 14. **Quest invitation accept/reject**\n",

      "body": "Also see https://github.com/redsolution/xabber-android/issues/634\n\nThis is not an issue in the existing version - more a proposal how we may get Jabber/XMPP to become a **real** alternative to WhatsApp, since I fear that people now think WhatsApp is \"good\" and \"secure\" as it introduced end-to-end-encryption. But with WhatsApp people are still depending on one single company - Facebook. And this should not continue like this. But just telling people, they should move to Jabber doesn't really help since many users find Jabber too complicated and only suitable for \"tech-savvy geeks\".\n\n_What makes WhatsApp so popular?_\n\nWell - you don't need to create any account using a username/password and you don't need to know the account names of your friends - their phone numbers are enough to check, if they use WhatsApp as well and to reach them. And as you already have the numbers in your phonebook you literally can start to chat with your friends instantly after installing WhatsApp.\n\n_How to achieve the same goal with XMPP/Jabber?_\n\nMy idea:\n\n1) Offer to enter an existing account OR to create an account using one of several well known Jabber providers (e.h. jabber.org, jabber.de etc.) with a password which is automatically created locally and which can be displayed or saved for later reference. The list of providers could be loaded dynamically from a server (see point 3) where providers could register their service.\n\n2) Detect the local phone number and/or allow the user a way to enter and confirm it manually.\n\n3) Provide an online service for a central registry where the client can send the hash the telephone number together with the Jabber-ID.\n\n4) Offer a function where the use can look up existing (hashed) phone numbers at the central registry to see, if others in his addressbook already use the service and if yes which Jabber-ID they have - so you can easily get in touch with others without the need of manually exchanging Jabber-IDs.\n\nI'm aware, that the central registry may be seen as \"evil\" - but this should be implemented as open source and should be run by a non profit organisation. To cover the cost for the servers, backup, maintenance etc. one could either rely on donations or ask for a yearly usage fee by the users with the first 1 to 3 months for free - if a user decides not to pay, the registered hash gets locked with a status \"user does not want to use the service any longer\", so others will not find it any longer. However - communication is still possible, as the central registry is only needed to find others more easily, not for the communication itself. Of course you still can contact Jabber-IDs directly without using a registry server.\n\nIt's only a very rough proposal and there may still be things I forgot - but what do you think? Does this sound interesting? Did anyone try this yet?\n\nI've been a professional software developer for the last 20+ years (see [http://arnowelzel.de/wp/en/about-me](http://arnowelzel.de/wp/en/about-me)). I have experience in Android development as well as in running and maintaining Linux servers (I run my own Jabber server as well as a number of domains and services for friends and family members) - so I can help wherever needed. But I don't want to do this without the support of others.\n",

      "body": "I had a chat with @mistydemeo yesterday about bottling Python stuff and I'd love to have some other input.\n\nBasically, as-is `depends_on :python` now will use the first Python in your PATH. If this is from Homebrew or the system Python there's slightly different behaviour. It's basically now used to set `PYTHONPATH` correctly and depend on Python if one is needed. Stuff like `scons` that doesn't install any bindings should not have a `depends_on :python` and will, as a result, always use a system Python. This case can be trivially bottled. \n\nWhere it gets complicated is when we want to start bottling either stuff that installs only bindings (e.g. `pyqt`) or stuff where the bindings are currently (and, sensibly should be e.g. `libxml2`) installed by default.\n\nAs far as I see it there are several options:\n1. `depends_on :python` stuff that's bottled will always use the system Python (the current behaviour). If people want to build against their own Python we tell them to use `--build-from-source`.\n2. Same as 1. except if the system Python is not first in their PATH we automatically build from source.\n3. `depends_on :python` stuff that's bottled will always use the Homebrew Python and will be built against that. If people want to build against their own or the system Python we tell them to use `--build-from-source`.\n4. Same as 3. except if the Homebrew Python is not first in their PATH we automatically build from source.\n5. We never build Python bindings by default; they are all made optional.\n\nPerhaps related to the above: we currently assume the system Python is 2.7. If it's found to not be (either someone has fucked around with it or it's an older version of OSX) then we use the Homebrew Python instead of the system one.\n\nMy personal preference here is either 1. or 2. I believe @mistydemeo's was either 3. or 4. I'm somewhat opposed to them for the reason that I'd rather not add a Homebrew Python dependency to e.g. `libxml2` just because we want to build the bindings.\n\nIf there's any other options here I'm missing, please let me know. @adamv @asparagui @jacknagel @mistydemeo @mxcl @manphiz @samueljohn @chrmoritz @jenshnielsen @daviewales I'd love your thoughts here.\n\nNote: I now hate Python.\n",

I'm not too sure about this though and can only report what I see. \n\nIn Cinnamon 1.2 (this didn't happen in 1.1.3) whenever messages are received in Skype and Skype is minimized, Skype comes to the forefront for me and jumps on top of all other open windows. Obviously this isn't behavior we want. In Cinnamon 1.1.3 a notification Window was displayed in the top right, as I recall, if that option was set in Skype. This is ideal behavior. In Gnome Shell Skype also behaves correctly and a notification top center appears telling me a new message is received. \n\nI've tweaked the chat and notification settings in Skype to just display a notification and not display anything at all. Either way, Skype comes to the forefront. \n\nSkype should not be coming to the top and I believe it might have something to do with notifications if something was changed on the back end of Cinnamon between 1.1.3 and now, because it did used to work well.\n\nAnyone else seeing this?\n",

It has some good things: it supports carbon copies and MOM, and feels responsive (unlike Xabber 2.0, sadly). Sadly, given the lack of leadership and project management skills shown here by the main developer, there is no way I would be relying on this application in the long term.

Your Thermostat will show you the readings in Celsius, but the sensors will be in Fahrenheit.\n2. If you change the temperature it'll send the commands in Fahrenheit. So, if you change the temperature with the up arrow it'll do the following:\n   1. Let's pretend that the display reads 21 degrees (that's in Celsius) and we are working with 'heat' mode only.\n   2. You press the up arrow\n   3. It'll tell your Ecobee to go to 22 decrees but commands are in Fahrenheit, so it's telling your Ecobee to go to 22 Fahrenheit. Typically the Ecobee has a minimum set temp and so it'll go to that (for me it's 15 degrees Celsius.) So although you wanted it to be 22 Celsius, it's now set to 15.\n   4. So basically, don't use the arrows\n3. If you use the 'home', 'away' routines, or any other smartapps that set the temperature of your ecobee, make sure to set the temperatures you type in are in Fahrenheit otherwise it'll do the same thing as in issue 2.\n4. The dials on the bottom of the screen (where you can set cool, or heat with a linear dial:\n   1. It read out in Celsius, but again sets the temp in Fahrenheit.\n   2. So if you want to change the temperature, use these dials, but you need to convert whatever you are setting it to. (move the dial to 72 if you want the house to be heated to 22 Celsius)\n   3. When you set the temperature using those dials, they will then stay in Fahrenheit  until you press the 'refresh' icon.\n\n**If you remember to convert properly, the devices and SmartApps should work just fine with the code as is, until someone updates it to handle Celsius properly.**\n",

      "body": "Good evening @SMSSecure developers,\n\nthank you so much for this fork of the original TextSecure App! Let me tell you that there are thousands of people out there searching for an alternative to TextSecure now. With great interest I stumbled upon your fork here and noticed that you stated `Drop Google services dependencies: push messages are not available in SMSSecure; if you want to keep them, SMSSecure is not for you.` Great stuff!\n\nAlthough my focus also lies on encrypted SMS, I am opening this Issue to discuss a possible chat _without GCM__. That means, if SMSSecure would be granted internet access, you could chat with each other just like in a chat room. Again, all of this should be done without Google and does *_NOT*\\* have to implemented right away, it's just a request and small glimpse of hope in my ongoing search for the \"perfect crypto-messenger\" which would cover both types of communications while being open source.\n\nOne more important thing: You should add your App to the [Secure Messaging Scorecard](https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard)! Thank you!\n",

Please comment / amend as you see fit:\n\nTitle of devroom:\nOpen source design\n\nElaborate description of proposed devroom (including possible topics):\nThe first open source design devroom last year was a success, with a healthy number of proposals submitted and great attendance. We would like to repeat this year. The goal of this devroom is to showcase design work done within free and open source projects, and strengthen the connections between designers involved in FOSS. We mean \"design\" in a broad sense, and we include within that term typography, graphic design, interaction design, user experience and design research activities. \n\nPossible topics include:\n- FOSS design tools\n- Design techniques and deliverables\n- Design - engineering collaboration approaches\n- User engagement and design research activities \n- Project case studies \n\nAfter receiving several requests, we will probably dedicate an hour to project pitches, so that projects looking for design contributions can introduce themselves and establish contact with designers eager to help. \n\nWhy does it fit FOSDEM?\nFOSS projects bring in particular challenges that affect almost every aspect of design. Techniques and approaches used in closed software settings must be re-purposed and adapted to FOSS. This is hard to do on your own. We hope that sharing experiences across projects and communities will help establish a set of practices that are effective, flexible and transferable across FOSS projects. \n\nThe devroom last year also proved to be a great way of connecting designers with FOSS projects looking for design contributors.\n",

      "body": "I've spend quite some time exploring the latest beta and took some notes concerning problems the average user will probably face in day to day usage.\niPhone5s 8.1.2 (Signal 2.0 Beta 1/31)\n##### Recipient Information / Interaction\n\nDon't hide it and enable user interaction! \nThe only way to get to the contact information of a recipient seems to be:\n1. Make sure you are in a group with them\n2. Go to the members view via group info overlay\n3. Select them in the list\n\nA far more suitable option would be to also have the \"group information\" metaphor in the 1 to 1 chat views.\nSignal wouldn't have to hide key verification and the contact information view would be accessible in a appropriate way. The overlay could state something like: [  Call  Verify  More   ]\n\nUsers expect to find buttons with the same function at the same places.\nI have noticed that calling a Signal v1.0.8 / Redphone only user leaves the chat view with the call icon in the upper right corner. Doing the same with an Signal 2.0 or android user that uses both, textsecure and redphone, the call icon is visible as long as I don't type anything in the textfield. Placing a call requires you to either:\n- Delete your input\n- Go back to the Inbox pretending you want to start a new conversation and press the call icon\n\n(your input will be lost either way see \"Keep state (keyboard text input)\")\n##### Branding < Usability\n\nThe Signal icon can't be part of the navigation stack!\nThis is the first serious iOS project I have seen where the app icon is used in the navigation stack and as view title.\nThe available main views are the \"Inbox\" and \"Archive\" (or other suitable strings) but not an icon.\n_Q: If i have a chat view open already where will I end up if i tap the signal icon back button?_\nThe navigation stack is not made for having a nice translation only. It's main purpose is providing information about where we're coming from and going to. Otherwise you could use a modal view without a semantic difference.\n\nAnother point is the textsecure send icon vs \"Send\" as string but I will bring that up in  #577\n##### Keep state (keyboard text input)\n\nIt is very disturbing to lose unfinished inputs when switching between chats. While every serious \"competing\" messaging app and the system app keeps it.\n",

What will happen to NuGet stuff if there's no `project.json` (nuget.json?) ?\n- [x] Will we be keeping the IntelliSense for dependency management? This is basically one of the best demo features we have for `project.json`.\n- [x] Are we keeping the JSON format for dependency management? XML is horrible for those kinds of things (see Maven). JSON is hands down simpler to represent those dependencies. \n\nIs it possible to have some clear response to those questions?\n\nThank you, \n",

We probably need to use the Firefox API at the extension level to walk into the active iframe and get the active form element or editable div.\n\nThis can be implemented by adding a menu to, for example browser.xul:\n\n```\n<keyset id=\"mainKeyset\">\n    <key id=\"key_convert\" key=\"x\" modifiers=\"accel alt\" oncommand=\"privlyExtension.keyboardCommand()\"/>\n</keyset>\n```\n\nThen adding the handler in extension-host-interface which asks for the cursor's current position using document.activeElement, and posts the content.\n",

      "body": "The colored messages are supposed to convey to the user the difference between push messages and SMS.\n\nBut the green color has confused myself, @sagischwarz, @phenx-de and literally everybody I have told to install the app. \n\n@phenx-de and myself have had a rather extensive discussion about the whole shebang in #908.\n\nWhat we came up with:\n- Use orange instead of green\n  - Green is widely used to indicate security aka encryption (green traffic light -> you're safe / good to go) and people are used very to it.\n  - Green is already used to indicate encryption / TS users in the contact list \n  - It also collides with several ideas in #741 and #910 to indicate trust\n  - Orange is the only color left in the Android color scheme, apart from purple: https://developer.android.com/design/style/color.html\n  - It doesn't have such a direct association as green and red have\n- Use toned down colors to indicate the most likely transport for messages that aren't sent yet (#796)\n  - Provides information about the most likely transport\n  - Indicates that the message hasn't been send yet\n- We should use color strips on a light grey message body. Either on the speakers' side or on top of the messages\n  - A whole window of completely colored messages looks very playful/cartoonish\n  - It improves the contrast of the gray message-delivered text and icons below the message, making it easier to read\n  - Scale down the importance of the transport information to a reasonable level \n- Color both the messages of sender and receiver\n  - While roaming and in some countries people have to pay (a lot) for incoming texts, so knowing if it's an SMS or not is important.\n  - The current implementation is inconsistent from a UX perspective.\n\nThis is what @phenx-de came up with:\n\n**Blue message sides for data and orange message sides for SMS:**\n![phenx_blue](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6797943/2306175/f6c9bfa2-a27d-11e3-9ac5-b862f93f24da.png)____![phenx_orange](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6797943/2306177/fe8b3982-a27d-11e3-80ff-e2623f780581.png)\n\nThose are two of my own mockup sets, one with white and one with grey backgrounds.\nThe first one doesn't have the nice new send icons because I couldn't be bothered to put them in after I made the mockups.\n\n**Colorset 1: Blue message headers for data, grey background:**\n![android_blue2_100_50_partly_grey_horizontal](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6797943/2306428/1ab6f3a6-a285-11e3-8df8-e80860aea8e9.jpg)\n\n**Colorset 1: Orange message headers for SMS, grey background:**\n![android_orange2_100_50_partly_grey_horizontal](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6797943/2306431/30ef168a-a285-11e3-9dae-9eab02852bb7.jpg)\n\n**Colorset 2: Blue message headers for data, white background:**\n![android_blue2_100_50_partly_white_horizontal_closed](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6797943/2307141/6e2b0812-a2a1-11e3-8cb5-fab22dac2ca7.jpg)\n\n**Colorset 2: Orange message headers for SMS, white background, encryption:**\n![android_orange2_100_50_partly_white_horizontal_closed](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6797943/2307143/75851422-a2a1-11e3-8561-5649d03e51ba.jpg)\n\n**Colorset 2: Orange message headers for SMS, white background, no encryption:**\n![android_orange2_100_50_partly_white_horizontal_open](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6797943/2307146/9b9f96b4-a2a1-11e3-9c3b-ec9ea5c485b4.jpg)\n\nPlease tell us what you think ;-)\n### I did a quick count for several different preferences.\n\n_If I misunderstood anybody, just tell me and I'll change your vote. If you have an opinion to one of those topics and aren't listed, just answer in the thread._\n\nThe first two are about the **shape** of the messages **only**, the colors are to be discussed apart from the way we use them.\n- **New style messages with colored bands (colors to be discussed) on top or on the side:**\n  @lindworm, @phenx-de, @noschinl, @Anaron, @monreal, @tinloaf @maulwuff\n- **Old style messages but with toned down colors:**\n  @virtualritz, @0xACE, @L3st3r\n- **Message color should indicate encryption**\n  @virtualritz, @lindworm, @mcginty \n- **Message color should indicate transport method**\n  @Anaron, @Cimbali, @0xACE, @L3st3r, @backspace\n- **Colors should stay the same (blue and green)**\n  @Anaron, @monreal, @sagischwarz, @0xACE, @L3st3r\n- **Colors should change**\n  @lindworm, @phenx-de, @maulwuff\n\nEverybody seems to like the toned down colors for sending, so at least we have one thing in common ;-)\n",

      "body": "Currently Tox only prevents against MitM attacks between users if it can be guaranteed that they each have the right Tox ID added. The Tox ID has to be exchanged over a probably insecure channel, which could easily just switch IDs around. This was talked about in IRC and while there's no real world case against this in Tox, here's an example attack:\n\nI tell someone my ID over Twitter. They add it. We're MitMed because their ISP was compromised. I have no way of knowing this on my end. This is analogous to trusting certificate authorities to give you valid site certificates.\n\nNext time we tell each other's IDs over IRC so we can check better. Unfortunately their insecure IRC is attacked by their compromised ISP and changes their ID recieves and my ID recieving. We're MitMed. I haven't seen an attack like this in the wild, but I can easily imagine it happening in email, especially as more and more people move to PGP.\n\nWe tell each other's Tox IDs over phone which we assume can't be MitMed due to voice prints. No MitMing can happen.\n\nIf Tox is meant to be passed as private messaging, there needs to be a better way to ensure it actually is private by authenticating people, and in a friendly manner.\n\nI suggest friend requests are turned in to two-step procedure, by adding a shared secret and required message from both ends.\n\nAlice would send a friend request, asking Bob when they first met. Bob sends his answer back, along with a question of his own, asking her which animal he's feared most. Alice verifies the answer and either sends back a rejection, or an approval and an answer to Bob's question. If Alice gets the question right, they add each other as they have the correct IDs.\n",

      "body": "These shouldn't be specific to ServiceWorker, and should move into the Fetch spec.\n\nThese bits stay the same:\n\n```\npartial interface ServiceWorkerGlobalScope : WorkerGlobalScope {\n  readonly attribute ServiceWorkerClients clients;\n}\n\ninterface ServiceWorkerClients {\n  Promise<sequence<Client>> getAll(optional ServiceWorkerClientQueryParams params);\n}\n\ndictionary ServiceWorkerClientQueryParams {\n  // include clients on the origin that aren't controlled by this SW\n  boolean includeUncontrolled;\n}\n```\n\nHere's the different bits:\n\n```\nenum ClientType { \"window\", \"worker\", \"sharedworker\", \"serviceworker\" };\n\ndictionary ClientOptions {\n  ClientType type = \"window\";\n};\n\n[Constructor(USVString url, optional ClientOptions options), Exposed=Window, Worker]\ninterface Client {\n  readonly attribute Promise<void> update;\n  readonly attribute VisibilityState visibilityState;\n  readonly attribute boolean focused;\n  readonly attribute USVString url;\n  readonly attribute ContextFrameType frameType;\n  readonly attribute ClientType type;\n  readonly attribute ServiceWorkerRegistration? serviceWorkerRegistration;\n  void postMessage(any message, optional sequence<Transferable> transfer);\n  Promise<void> focus();\n}\n```\n\nThe properties of a client do not change after construction unless **update** is called.\n\nThe **constructor** takes a `url` and `options`. The options are a bit useless at the moment, as it should throw if `type` is set to anything other than `window`. If `type` is `window` (the default), the user agent is requested to open a new tab/window. This may depend on a user-interaction event, as `window.open` does now.\n\n**update** causes `visibilityState`, `focused`, `url`, and `serviceWorkerRegistration` to refresh to the client's current values. If the client hasn't yet succeeded/failed to open, it waits. It rejects if the client is no longer running, or failed to ever run. It doubles as a ready method. **Question**: Do we need a ready method regardless?\n\n**visibilityState** is from [Page Visibility](http://www.w3.org/TR/page-visibility/#VisibilityState). It reports `hidden` for non-window types.\n\n**focused** is the result of `hasFocus()` from the [focus management APIs](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focus-management-apis). **Question**: Or should it be true if the browser window has focus and the containing tab is active? As in, should it be true for a top-level client if a contained client (such as an iframe) has focus? Should it be true for a frame in a frameset even if focus is in one of the other frames in the frameset? Should it be true for a top-level client if docked devtools has focus?\n\n**url** is the current url of the client. This is the script url for workers, but can change throughout the life of a window via hash changes and `pushState`. **Question**: Or should this be the creation url, therefore static for windows too? Once we get `clients.claim()`, it'll be taking over clients based on creation url so `pushState` cannot allow pages to \"jump scope\" and be claimed by a registration they otherwise wouldn't be.\n\n**frameType** comes from the [fetch spec](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-context-frame-type). It lets you tell iframes apart from top-level windows.\n\n**type** lets you tell windows apart from different types of worker.\n\n**serviceWorkerRegistration** lets you know if the client is controlled by a worker or not.\n\n**postMessage** does what you'd expect.\n\n**focus** rejects if the type is not \"window\". Calls `window.focus()` on the related window. Resolves if successful, rejects otherwise. This may depend on a user-interaction event. **Question**: Should this implicitly call update?\n\nI thought about having separate constructors rather than a `type` attribute, such as `WindowClient`, `WorkerClient` etc etc, but that means we'd have more constructors that'd throw, and I know how y'all hate that!\n",

Because our schema will be standardized, based on the existing [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/), WordPress developers can make modification to the controllers without breaking clients. In fact, properly written clients will know how to interpret the modification, provide UI for it, etc.\n\nEach controller's schema will be used to:\n- Report expected data format for each endpoint.\n- Programmatically generate API docs.\n- <del>Validate request input.</del>\n- <del>Ensure response data confirms to a schema.</del>\n\nSchemas will be optional for custom endpoints, but enforced for core endpoints. In order for a WordPress developer to add or remove a field, they'll first need to modify the schema. \n\n**Update 1/31**: For those just coming into the conversation, the entire thread has a good amount of history. At this time the large open question can be summarized as: should WordPress support (and expose) dynamic schemas, or should the core schema be fixed, and any modifications to the schema sandboxed?\n\nSee #718\n",

In my oppinion this model has some problems which I'd like discuss here and propose a different model. I created this issue because right now there is no chance to change the course of the discussion in the mentioned issues. So I chose to not interfere any further, let the participants improve their model and work on an alternative model separately. \n### II. Criticism of the proposed model\n\nThis is the visual model as proposed in the aforementioned issues. \n##### Contact list\n\nI had to make this up myself based on #741. And yes, this has been done with MS Paint:\n![contact-list-with locks1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428418/bb727eb2-ac46-11e3-9d88-e84acd5fbac4.png)\n##### Messaging window\n\n![4](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428409/7e1cc54a-ac46-11e3-9430-5338739b0c08.jpg)\n![3](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428410/7e247664-ac46-11e3-8fe7-449465b7b6f5.jpg)\n![2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428411/7e29f9e0-ac46-11e3-88fb-e3ce0df4ef09.jpg)\n![1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428412/7e2f288e-ac46-11e3-8e99-bf421b45bc3b.jpg)\n##### Message history\n\nAs far as I know this is still missing, at least I didn't find a specific issue about it and therefore didn't find any screenshots.\n##### Discussion\n1. There is no coherent visual security schema for TS. We need one schema for all these three areas in TS: contact list, message history, messaging window.\n2. Too much information and too much redundancy which leads to a cluttered and less usable interface. There is no \"security at one glance\". \n3. The icons under each message are too small. Visually impaired people might not even notice them. Those symbols don't increase with the chosen text size. Also, depending on the colour, the icons under each message are hard to read because the contrast is too low. Another issue with those icons is that there could be issues on smaller screens with less dpi.\n4. The lock symbol used on the contact list doesn't visualize the idea of three security levels well enough. Threema's indicator does so by telling the user that there are three levels and contrasting it with how many he already has achieved. I think this schema also presents an incentive to gain better security which the uni-coloured lock symbol doesn't.\n### III. The alternative model\n\nI have used Threema's dots to implement the security indicator but I have also \"designed\" some other possible indicators (see below). Maybe it's not even possible to use Threema's dots due to legal reasons. This is only an example. \n\nBear with me, I really don't know my way around a real graphics program so this is all done with MS Paint... ;) \n##### Contact list\n\n![contact-list - kopie](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428435/0c95c7bc-ac48-11e3-9b1e-2121ae85c152.png)\n##### Messaging window\n\n![messaging window](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428433/0c7fd6d2-ac48-11e3-94c6-716cc49d1f74.png)\n##### Message history\n\n![message-history](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428434/0c859752-ac48-11e3-9684-bfbca26a338e.png)\n##### Short explanation of how this model works:\n\nFirst of: Threema doesn't use SMS, so TS has an enhanced model and more use cases.\n\nLevel 1 (red): The user is communicating via SMS. It doesn't matter if the number of his contact is already in his contact list. As far as I know, SMS can be easily fabricated so it doesn't even matter if the user receives encrypted SMS, because the other party could be anybody, at least as long as there has been no verification of keys. So whether the user is communicationg via encrypted or unencrypted SMS, with the number in his address book or not, doesn't matter. The only possibility to communicate securely over SMS is to use TS with a verified contact, which would result in a green indicator.\n\nLevel 2 (orange): This is for push messages that come from contacts in the usuer's address book which are not yet verified. Encryption is being used. **EDIT:** We should award SMS an orange indicator if there have been previous push messages and we already know that the key is connected to that number. In the case where a SMS reaches our phone from somebody unknown to us, this SMS will still have a red indicator.\n\nLevel 3 (green): The user has verified the contact from his contact list and uses encryption. \n##### Discussion:\n1. Only one message colour for everything. Message colour doesn't resemble security any more, only the security indicator does. The message colour can be any colour we choose and it should be customizable in the future anyway. Though the colour should probably not be the green, orange or red of the security indicator so that people don't get confused. Also we need better contrast with the timestamp.\n2. The user can understand the security level with one glance at the security indicator. No locks, no verification badges and no transport symbols under the messages. No tiny symbols, that can't be ready by visually impaired people or won't be displayed correctly on lew-res screens. Colour-vision impaired people can still see which security level is being used. \n   This leaves more room for what the user actually wants: communicating. I think we are too much in his face, constantly displaying something. Under each message there will only be a timestamp. I think there should be a warning message if a contact with two numbers (one of them isn't registered with TS) talks to the user and the security changes. Only switching to a red indicator probably doesn't cut it. Again, the indicator always tells you the security of your _next_ message. If you want to know the security of your last messages, you will have to tap and hold on a message so that you can access message details. \n3. Not displaying transportation under each message might be unwise, because users who pay for SMS or Data depending on usage really want to know what TS is doing. I think the solution to this is asking the user at first start how TS should handle this. As far as I know this will be or already has been integrated into TS so we probably don't have to worry about it that much. This means either TS is not allowed to act in a way that would cost the user money or TS will ask the user what to do. The way of transportation will always be in sight, though, because the text in the message composing area will always display whether the next message will be a SMS or push message. The only thing that I would wish somebody would add is that I could allow TS to use SMS for 15min, a few hours or a day, but ask me again once this time is over. \n4. The paperlane doesn't have a lock anymore either.\n### IV. Some ideas for security indicators\n\nThis indicator needs to convey three levels of security and the user should always get the idea that more is better. \n\nAgain, purely MS paint.\n\n<Screenshots>\n\nThis is taken from Google Chrome:\n![chrome-indicator - enlarged](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428440/832c158e-ac48-11e3-8d30-dc178543e605.png)\n\nThis is the modified TS icon:\n![textsecure-icon-indicator-small](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428439/8325c01c-ac48-11e3-9b07-cca384f61647.png)\n\nCan anybody think of more?\n### V. Conclusion\n\nOk, this is the model I wanted to propose. Feedback is very welcome. It would also help a lot if somebody could just make new, more professional looking mockups of the screenshots.\n",

In my head, he's pretty much exactly the market that Waltz is targeting.\n\nAmong some technical issues, his primary feedback is that he no longer understands what Clef does.  He originally understood that Clef was a password **replacement** (which it is).  However, the extension brands itself as Clef - we spin the Clef logo, that huge Clef-branded wave page pops up, you use the Clef app.  It feels _a lot_ like the extension _is_ Clef.  This made my brother think that Clef was actually a password locker.\n\nSo there's some things that need to be answered and thought about here:\n- What is Waltz?  Is it an extension of Clef?  Is it a password manager that just happens to use Clef?  Is it both?  Do we want to market it in one way so it explicitly doesn't seem like the other?\n- What are our goals with Waltz?  Is it purely a \"growth hack\" to increase the visibility of Clef?  Are we actually trying to build a password manager that does security better than the competition?\n- How can we clearly communicate this unusual relationship with Clef to the user?\n- Does our target user _care_?  If they just put in a password and never think about it again, will they not know the difference between that and Clef?  Or are we working with techies who throw red flags when giving out their passwords?\n- At what point are we diluting the Clef brand so much that Waltz is more harm than good?\n",
