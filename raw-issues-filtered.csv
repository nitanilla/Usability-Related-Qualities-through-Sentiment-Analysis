Rocket.Chat Apps can provide a starting point for bespoke chat ops / messaging automation, to replace the current Internal Hubot.

Note the distinction between _internal_ and _external_ bots:

- External hosted bots use a platform or framework adapter to login and operate a user account. They are suited to messaging-heavy interactions and/or where maintenance or processes are independent of Rocket.Chat.
- Internal bots are tightly coupled with the architecture of Rocket.Chat, but (at least currently) have limited features for conversational UI. Their provisioning and operation is dependent on the Rocket.Chat server.

## Why do it?

The internal Hubot is outdated, it’s utility for enterprises and teams is limited and its documentation and usability is a challenge blocking many users from making the most of it.

Rocket.Chat now has much better options for messaging automation from progress toward an app marketplace model and the recent updates towards an SDK for multiple bot platform/framework adapters.

Integrating custom processes into the core codebase and the generic “Rocket.Cat” bot identity is harder to maintain and can be confusing for users to interact with.

## How will it help?

- Instances can maintain bot driven logic without requiring a fork of core Rocket.Chat
- Customised identity for bots in a Rocket.Chat instance distinct from the “system bot”
- Clearer semantics between system notifications and instance’s specific business logic
- Access to apps API endpoints will open new features to internal bots
- Multiple internal bots can provide different behaviours from unique bot user profiles

## What does it need?

- App with same features as a bot: receive, send, reply, store data, call API
- Provide http listeners for triggering internal methods / interactions
- Make http requests to get data to trigger or populate a message send
- Documentation for getting started with defining a new bot app and writing scripts
- Boilerplate examples to show simple common use cases achieved by bot app

## What’s the plan?

- Identify some use cases of current internal Hubot extensions
- Build and document example implementations with Rocket.Chat Apps to replace Internal Hubot interactions
- Build a replacement for Rocket.Cat as default packaged app-bot
- Update docs for a clear purpose for the single system bot as a simple service butler, that will no longer be extended with instance specific scripts.

## How can we help?

If this spec effects you and you’d like to help out, what we need at this stage is to understand the types of use cases currently implemented with the Internal Hubot, so we can provide useful templates and guides to migrate your Hubot scripts into Rocket.Chat apps.

There seem to be two related issues:
1. The search sidebar closes on idle timeout
2. The user interface for Idle Time Limit does not specify the unit in which the timeout is being configured

The combination of these made for a very vexing issue that took a long time to isolate, where the search sidebar was totally unusable due to constantly closing every few milliseconds, making it impossible to search for and contact someone.

### Server Setup Information:

* Version of Rocket.Chat Server: 0.63.1
* Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS  (4.4.0-119-generic)
* Deployment Method(snap/docker/tar/etc): SNAP
* Number of Running Instances: 1
* DB Replicaset Oplog: Enabled?
* Node Version: v8.9.4
* mongoDB Version: v3.2.7

### Client Binary

* Rocket.Chat+ Version 2.10.5
* Windows 7 Professional x64 Service Pack 1

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Adjust the automatic-away idle time limit to something really low:
My Account <U+2192> Preferences <U+2192> USER PRESENCE <U+2192> Idle Time Limit: 300
2. Go back to normal messaging, then press the magnifying glass ""Search"" button to bring up the Search sidebar.
3. Observe that in 300 milliseconds or less, the search bar closes, making it unusable for searching.

### Expected behavior:

The search sidebar does not close.
The Idle Time Limit specifies the unit of time.

### Actual behavior:

The search sidebar closes too quickly for usability.
The Idle Time Limit does not specify the unit of time.","2018-04-11T01:25:58Z","2018-05-22T18:54:08Z","https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues/10415",1,48.86343,"kurji","https://api.github.com/repos/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat","usability",0,1,0,0,0,0,0

i´m a very fan of telegram and i use it on lots of devices. great job for the lightweight feel of the messenger.
i wanted to introduce telegram to a blind user but had to realize, the (windows) client is not good to use with a screen reader, i.e. zoomtext of aisquared... the software does not even understand what to do when using the ""read this"" command and selecting a portion of the telegram chat window.
idk, but maybe this is only a small fix so the chat messages are understood as text inside a frame and the message input field is treated like an textarea (which would be readalout while typing).
it would increase for accessibility of that otherwise modern chat system.

i tried the web version of telegram which is not usably for the blind either. at least the message text is recognized then -> ""read this"" command reads the chat but still the user would need to select the correct portion of the chat. is there are plain-text only version of the web app available?

"11",178987988,"open","Promoting Usability within the Clincian-Patient Encounter via the SHR","### Introduction

Effective use of EHRs is recognized as a key element in achieving the Triple Aim—improving the patient experience of care (including quality and satisfaction), improving the health of populations and reducing the per capita cost of health care. Yet health care workers report unprecedented levels of burnout and dissatisfaction. This trend has prompted expansion of the Triple Aim to the Quadruple Aim [[1](http://www.annfammed.org/content/12/6/573.full)], which adds the goal of improving the work life of health care workers, both clinicians and non-clinicians, to the original three initiatives. EHR technology is cited as a major contributing factor to physician burnout [[2](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR400/RR439/RAND_RR439.pdf)]. Family Physicians have colloquially advocated for ""Replacing the WHACK [-a-Mole implementation of EHR driven workflows] with the LAC [Life After Clinic]"" as vision for what how improved EHR usability should reclaim time spent currently on after-hours documentation for the personal lives of clinicians.

Here, usability challenges will be defined as product features or situations in which the design and implementation of EHRs do not align with the cognitive and/or workflow requirements and preferences of users within and across professional and patient roles and settings. This memo aims to describe the usability challenges that affect the clinician-patient relationship, which represent strategies by which the use of SHR can be promoted. This memo will aid in prioritizing key features of SHR development, which represent the tactics by which SHR will promote usability.
### The structure of the broader problem of usability challenges

Taking the above definition a a starting place, several interrelated domains emerge.
- _Product design versus implementation_
  Poor EHR design limits the potential for physician-patient engagement by interfering with face-to-face interaction with patients. Many local implementations of EHR products have been customized in an attempt to suit local needs, but the quality of these implementations varies greatly. EHR implementation is often viewed as a fixed cost, rather than an ongoing investment, requiring regular updates, training and iteration to function optimally.
- _Cognitive requirements versus workflow requirements_
  Current EHRs focus primarily on data collection rather than synthesis of data at the patient level. Current data synthesis methods are typically neither context nor patient specific. The lack of context awareness can lead to frequent clinical and administrative reminders that may force physicians to make hard stops, even for non-urgent matters, to address these issues. Features such as pop-up reminders, cumbersome menus and poor user interfaces interrupt workflow and  increase cognitive demands by forcing users to ""hunt"" through the interface to retrieve data, record data, and trigger actions in the clinical workflow. 
- _Best practices versus preferences_
  Physicians have not defined the clinical workflows health data products, such as EHRs, need to support. As a speciality that prides itself on individual excellence through purposeful effort and autonomous decision making, physicians may recoil to the notion that clinical workflows should be adapted to the needs of EHR systems. 
- _Variation within professional roles_
  Few EHR systems are built to accommodate physicians’ practice patterns and work flows, which vary depending on size, specialty and setting. Within one practice setting, workers of the same professional designation may have different roles based on unique training, responsibilities or level of experience (e.g. resident physician vs attending physician, medical assistant versus master medical assistant).
- _Variation across professional roles_
  The scope of practice of non-physician health care professionals varies according to state licensure laws. Current technology often requires clinicians to enter data or perform tasks that other team members could be empowered to complete by preventing delegation of tasks as appropriate.
- _Variation across settings_
  Various characteristics external to an EHR system - e.g. architectural, staffing, patient population - can profoundly affect the successful implementation of an EHR within a given clinical setting.
- _Professionals versus patients_
  EHR design has been heavily influenced by the data capture and billing needs of clinicians, and external influences (e.g. meaningful use) not relevant to the clinician-patient encounter. Most EHR systems are not designed to support digital patient engagement. Failure to incorporate increased interoperability between EHR systems, mHealth platforms, and telehealth technologies represents a missed opportunity to promote health and wellness and manage chronic illnesses.
### Not all usability challenges are directly related to EHR software design

As noted above, a number of factors external to EHRs may have considerable effects on usability, such as:
- sub-optimal implementation
- risk management concerns
- institutional liability concerns
- regulatory requirements 
- inadequate training of users
- suboptimal practice workflow processes 
### Not all clinician-patient interactions involve face-to-face encounters utilizing EHRs

At least 7 types of physician-patient encounter are envisioned in the health care system of the near future. The majority of these encounter types do not require use of an EHR at the point of care, which allows the possibility that a light weight alternative application could service the health data requirements of the patient and clinician.

|  | _Synchronous_ | _Asynchronous_ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _EHR Necessary_ | Face-to-face | EHR portal message |
| _EHR Optional_ | Video chat, Telephone | Secure email,  Secure SMS, App-based messaging |
### Key usability challenges physicians face with current EHRs

The American Medical Association identified key challenges physicians face with current EHRs [[3](https://www.aace.com/files/ehr-priorities.pdf)]. Of these, several deal directly with usability challenges within the clinician-patient interaction.
- Interference with the patient visit
- Issues with care coordination due to lack of interoperability
- Increased cognitive workload for physicians
- Lack of system-design support for team-based care
- Communicating with patients in a changing digital landscape

Other key usability challenges deal more directly with the design and implementation of specific EHR products.
- Lack of data liquidity and high switching costs
- Lack of product modularity to support unique physician practices and population needs
- Insufficient support for incorporating end-user input into product design and post-implementation feedback for product improvement
### Usability priorities

Based on these challenges, the AMA recommends eight EHR usability priorities to be urgently addressed. Of these, half relate directly to the clinician-patient interaction.

**_Not Directly Related to Clinician Patient Interaction**_
3) Promote care coordination.
4) Offer product modularity and configurability.
6) Promote interoperability and data exchange.
8) Expedite user input into product design and post-implementation feedback.

**_Directly Related to Clinician Patient Interaction**_
1) Enhance physicians’ ability to provide high-quality patient care 
- Promote effective communication and engagement between patients and physicians 
- Reconfigure EHR interface seamlessly into the practice  
- Rearrange electronic devices in the care setting to limit distractions. |

2) Support team-based care
- Allow physicians, or AI-agents, to dynamically allocate and delegate work to appropriate members of the care team as permitted by institutional policies. |

5) Reduce cognitive work load
- Manage information flow and adjust for context, environment and user preferences. 
- Balance use of unstructured narrative data, which many physicians find more succinct and reflective of the patient’s perspective and physician’s thought process, against the need for structured data to assist with computability |

7) Facilitate digital and mobile patient engagement  
- Support synchronous and asynchronous communication with the clinical team 
- Support health promotion and management of chronic disease 
### Way Forward

Based on the above findings, the following six projects are submitted for discussion. This is by no means intended to be an all inclusive of candidate projects that could demonstrate the potential for SHR to address usability challenges in the clinician-patient interaction. 

**_1) Natively support USPSTF Grade A and B and Choosing Wisely recommendations within the SHR**_
The United States Preventive Services Task Force Grade A and B recommendations detail the preventive health services that uncontroversially apply to all patients [[4](https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/uspstf-a-and-b-recommendations/)]. The Choosing Wisely campaign is a collaboration between all major medical societies. Its recommendations highlight over-utilized services that provide low value to patient care and the health system [[5](http://www.choosingwisely.org/clinician-lists/)]. Taken together, these recommendations represent much of the uncontroversial ""what to do"" and ""what not to do"" elements of care. Since a primary care physician managing an average patient panel size would need to spend 37 hours a week providing all Grade A and B recommended services, without any other clinical activities, automating as much of this process as possible could generate a rapid positive impact for primary care workflow [[6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447803/)].

**_2) Reconfigure data entry to support relationship building, minimize distractions, and be more user-friendly for clinicians and patients**_
The data liquidity achieved through implementation of SHR allows for an ecosystem of related services to assist clinicians and patients with documentation. A variety of startups demonstrate some various approaches. Bright.md markets a ""virtual physicians assistant"" that will take a history through a basic online interface and develop a basic treatment plan [[7](http://bright.md/)]. The documentation can then be reviewed and altered by the clinician. Tonic provides accessible, easy to use, web and mobile based questionnaires to assist patients with entering, reviewing and updating the data in their health records [[8](http://www.tonicforhealth.com/)]. Lexenco leverages UMLS Metathesaurus concepts based and an open-source NLP engine to provide SaaS processing of clinical content and association with UMLS concept IDs [[9](http://www.lexenco.com/)]. Each of these individual offerings represents a partial solution to important usability challenges listed above. Leveraging multiple third-party solutions, i.e. these or others, within a clinical environment highlights the ""plug and play"" modularity that SHR empowers, demonstrating short term benefit to clinicians and patients without lengthy development timelines of a bespoke, potentially duplicative technology.

**_3) Support for differential diagnosis**_
The differential diagnosis (DDx) is a ranking of the likely explanation for the presenting signs and symptoms of a given patient. A DDx is most often ranked by probability, although it may also be ranked by disease severity (i.e. prognosis) or ease of treatment (i.e. pragmatism). The discipline of compiling and reviewing a DDx underlies much of the expert thinking in medicine. Computer systems are adept at generating probability-weighted lists. An implementation of SHR could assist with compiling a DDx and integrating it within the clinical workflow, as a form of CDS. Technology developed by Inferscience is relevant to this objective [[10](http://www.inferscience.com/)].

**_4) Solving the Usability Challenges of Non-Physician Health Care Workers**_
This is included as a placeholder. Susan and I agree that this is very important; however it may be out of scope as a primary focus for Jay Schnitzer's request to address clinician-patient usability.

**_5) Assessing and Addressing Social Determinants of Health within the Clinical Encounter**_
Placeholder for now. 

**_6) SMS-based platform for asynchronous communication with the care team**_
 Eva is an NLP-powered algorithm with access to the EHR and practice management software. She records her conversation with the patient within the EHR. Eva can report or collect structured data observations to or from the patient. When she does not know an answer, she triggers a medical assistant, triage nurse, or scheduler to call the patient, depending upon the issue. She can address most of the common reasons for calling the physician office, e.g. scheduling appointments, obtaining recent lab results, requesting updated referrals or medication refills, without a human-in-the-loop, and quickly trigger the appropriate human when necessary.

Any questions, improvement suggestions or general discussion about security. Ask and comment freely. I also wanted to clarify why I did the things and improvements this way. The document will be updated randomly when new ideas appear.

### HTTP or sockets -> native messaging
When a browser extension starts a process using native messaging first it loads a JSON config file that holds the path to the binary file and a list of allowed browser extensions. So when comparing this to the plain passifox/chromeipass and KeePassHTTP it much more secure. To gain access to your database or the KeePassXC process a malicous browser extension will not be accepted and native messaging returns an error. To ""hack"" the connection between native messaging browser extension and KeePassXC you'd need a rogue application that must change the JSON file content **and** provide an incorrect or malformed version of the KeePassXC itself. The downside is that the KeePassXC-Browser extension basically controls the KeePassXC process and it cannot be started beforehand or the connection fails. In short, it's pretty secure after all.

### Proxy application support
This new browser intergration also supports Unix domain sockets (named pipes under Windows) that could handle any messages between KeePassXC-Browser and KeePassXC with the keepassxc-proxy application. This method is much safer than the original KeePassHTTP provides.  When using a proxy application through Unix domain sockets or the old KeePassHTTP method it's of course possible that a malicious application captures your keys and acts like a ""verified"" client. Currently there's no safe method to ensure if the client is valid without any extra user interaction. Still, libsodium provides a slightly better encryption so the connection doesn't rely on just one base64 encoded key that's visible in packet capture.. Instead it uses a keypair where only public keys are transferred but you need the secret key(s) to encrypt or decrypt the data.

### Other improvements
The version 0.3.4 added a feature that you can lock the database from the popup without needing to go back to KeePassXC. With 0.3.5 the database states are received from KeePassXC instead of polling the state continously.

The previous versions (including the original passifox/chromeipass) didn't update the active tab credentials even when there were changes with the databases. This means that if your database has locked because of a timeout or you have switched to another database tab the active tab/page still holds valid credentials in the memory from the previously active database. This is no good. Now the credentials will be cleared if the database is locked or switched to a locked one. Also, if you have two databases open the credentials are received automatically from the active database even if you switch from one to another. All this happens without needing to reload the page.","2017-10-16T12:49:08Z","2018-06-09T13:28:51Z","https://github.com/varjolintu/keepassxc-browser/issues/28",40,24.770838,"varjolintu","https://api.github.com/repos/varjolintu/keepassxc-browser","usability",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For further clarification, I am talking about PGP in the context of email.

Materials on PGP's suckiness abound, but here's an incomplete list just off the top of my head (in rough order of how terrible they are):

1. PGP leaks metadata like a champion, including the subject line and recipients
2. Outdated crypto, no forward secrecy, big keys
3. Fingerprint verification is really hard to explain
4. Super easy to fuck up _basic_ UX stuff, like e.g. not encrypting to yourself so you can't read your sent mail
5. Most if not all PGP UIs are terrible, it's really easy to accidentally turn off encryption
6. Revocation isn't reliable
7. Even if you do set up refreshes to get revocation you leak your entire social graph to the keyserver, and often keyservers literally speak plaintext so you can sniff this stuff completely passively (unless you use parcimonie but that doesn't come set up by default, _anywhere_ AFAIK, and no one knows about it so it's worthless)
8. There's no real multi-device experience, particularly for your own trust decisions
9. Trust in the Web of Trust is completely broken because you have no idea what security steps _other_ people take, which is a big problem because you're relying on other people's signatures (and therefore security) to compute trust paths; see also https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/030235.html

I could go on and on but I'll stop there. https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/08/13/whats-matter-with-pgp/ goes into a lot of these points too.

There are better alternatives. I have [tried to teach PGP](https://strugee.net/cryptoparty-seattle/) in the real world and both times it has gone exceedingly poorly to the point where I abandoned it entirely and taught Signal instead. Keysigning parties are a joke; they're _somewhat_ useful in very small contexts/communities like Debian but not at scale.

I will also point out that a lot of these problems can be fixed. But by the time you fix them, you'll end up with a brand-new backwards-incompatible protocol that basically reimplements Signal, only poorly.

ricochet:device1,device2,device3

This would of course make the IDs longer, but as they're not intended to be human-readable I'm not sure that's a major issue.

For existing contacts, you would then need to send them the new ID the next time you communicate with them so that messages get sent to each device.

I'm not sure what the best UI flow for adding new devices would be. Something involving a BIG DAMN WARNING that all messages sent from this device would be readable by the others.

### Bug description

There is a common _usability bug_ of Signal. Lets say you are getting a Signal message on your mobile. You select the notification message, switching to your Signal app, opening the conversation. You now see the last part of the conversation dialogue between you and this single person. You now answer the message of that person, writing things that are meant to be read only by that single person. Just after sending the message (or never?) you realize that you just sent this message to a group chat of many people whose conversation happens to be filled with messages of you and the other person as long as your screen view/history is showing.

Therefore, you accidentally sent a personal message to a group conversation which is a common bug I notice many times.

You assumed, that you wrote your message in a private conversation because you have seen only one person's answers. Other people did not write for a longer period of time to that group conversation. You could have read the header information where you could have seen that this is not a person-to-person conversation. However, you concentrate on the bottom of the screen, where the received message could be seen and answer right below it. Therefore, it is easy to overlook the group chat header when answering a message in Signal. There is no other distinction between group and personal conversations.

(This bug was issues before as https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7158 and got closed due to spring cleaning and a changed template)

### Steps to reproduce

The situation in a private chat:

- switch to a person-to-person conversation with person X
- you see the most recent chat messages of X and yourself
- you can answer right away and the message get sent to X

Now the situation in a group chat:

- now switch to a group conversation where X is part of as well
- the most recent messages are only from you and X
- it is easy to assume that this is a private chat between you and X: you only see messages from X and yourself, the lower part of the screen looks the same in group chats and in private chats:
  - input field
  - default text hint
  - send button
  - style
- As a result, private text messages get sent to a group chat

**Actual result:** Private message get sent to a group of people.
**Expected result:** User should have recognized that the message is about to be sent to a group of people and not to a private chat.

For a messaging app that emphasizes the importance of privacy, sending sensitive private information to a group of people by accident is considered an important issue IMO. Since there are easy to implement technical solutions to prevent this (see below), this is considered a bug and not a feature request.

### Device info
<!-- replace the examples with your info -->
**Device:** OnePlus 5
**Android version:** 8.0.0
**Signal version:** 4.17.5

### Possible mitigations

There are multiple possible ways to fix this issue. A distinct background color is one which seemed to be a low-hanging fruit in terms of quick-fix because this features exists in the personal conversation settings and not in the group conversation settings for no obvious reason. However, there is still the issue that Signal might give away ""red"" for an arbitrary personal conversation but this only leads to you looking more closely to the header, realizing that it is save to write personal stuff in this conversation.

Changing the ""Signal message"" default text of the input line would be another possibility although in my opinion, this is too subtle. I don't think that users do read this default text any more. Things like that is likely to be ignored just like banner ads are being ignored easily despite their prominent use of color or animation.

I do think that changing the send-button to something like a send button that graphically includes multiple smaller send buttons or multiple of those paper-plane-symbols would be a very good distinction. IMHO this would be easy to notice and easy to explain: multiple paper-plane symbols reflect multiple messages that are sent out to multiple Signal clients.

### Bug description
I sleep my computer when it's off.
I often wake my computer from sleep, and then Signal plays catch-up with all the activity from my phone or other clients.
__Every single message__ received while my computer was asleep shows a pop-up notification, and makes the new-message 'ding-a-ling' noise.
Today, I have hundreds in the catch-up queue. I've been sitting here for over 5 minutes so far just hearing my computer ding and spamming notifications about messages I received the last couple of days.

Does this happen if my computer is off rather than asleep? I can imagine perhaps, since the client was launched before the messages were received, that when I wake the computer, it thinks the messages were received during this active session?

### Steps to reproduce
- Run the desktop client (I'm using electron, but i think chrome works too)
- Sleep the PC
- Do activity with your phone
- Wake the PC, prepare for a torrent of activity...

**Actual result:** Torrent of catch-up activity; very annoying
**Expected result:** Signal should know my computer was off, and not give me notifications that have already been read on other devices.

### Platform info
**Operating System**: Win10 64
**Browser**: Electron
**Signal version:** [...where is the version information on the electron client?]

But I do not have access to that, so I decided to post this here.
Feel free to move it and close this issue.

This is an alternative proposal for the one at http://wiki.tox.im/Multiple_Devices.
A key feature is the fact that it does not require a change to the Tox network protocol and a client (such as Venom) can implement this.

**_Summary:**_
Instead of creating 2 identities and linking them, the same identity is shared over the 2 devices transparently. This reduces the technical complexity a lot, and reduces user confusion: Each user will have only one public key to share with his friends.

**_How it works**_:

**Linking the devices (Sharing the identity):**
Alice already has an identity - which is a public/private key pair - on her PC, Alice decides to use her smartphone with Tox. Alice clicks a ""Add an existing identity"" button on the smartphone. Alice then inputs her public key. In the background, Alice's smartphone creates a temporarily identity and contacts Alice's PC via DHT. It then sends a ""linking request"", Alice accepts that request on her PC (We could make her type a secret phrase on both ends for security). Once the request is accepted, the Private/Public key pair is transferred - securely, either via DHT or p2p - from Alice's PC to Alice's smartphone. Alice's smartphone discards the temporarily identity and adopts the newly received one.
Alice's smartphone then ""goes online"", see next section.

**When a device goes online - Cooperation between devices sharing the same key:**
When a devices starts up / finishes the step above, it checks if another device is already online with the same public key (Scanning the DHT possibly requires a temporarily identity, correct me here). 2 Things can occur:

_A: There is a device already online with that same public key:_
We'll call the device which is already online the ""master"" (the PC in Alice's case).
We'll call the newly connecting device a ""slave"" (the smartphone in Alice's case).

The slave contacts the master via DHT (via a temporarily identity), and asks to be synced. The slave can easily prove it has possession of the same private key as the master by completing a challenge. Once this is proven, the master and the slave sync up: The slave(Smartphone) initiates a peer-to-peer connection to the master(PC), it then **opts out of the DHT**. Now, the phone is merely a ""remote interface"" to the PC, which is the actual Tox peer: Any action Alice performs on the slave(smartphone) is sent to the master (PC), only the master contacts the DHT and/or Alice's friends. Any action the PC receives from the DHT/from alice's friends is sent to the smartphone.

To sum it up, the slave is a ""remote session"" of the master.

_B: There is no device already online with that same public key:_
In that case, the newly connecting devices connects normally using the normal Tox procedure, no science here. The devices then becomes the ""master"".

**Some remarks:**
1. This also works with multiple slaves. The master should randomly choose a ""top slave"" among all the connected slaves, in case the master disconnects, the ""top slave"" becomes the master and the remaining slaves reconnect to their new master. 
2. The linking phase is really easy and already partially implemented: It is very similar to accepting a friend request.
3. The entire procedure can be implemented via a client and does not require changes to the Tox network protocol. (But it's best to implement in Tox Core)

What happens instead?

Significant battery drain.

Please provide any additional information below. Attach a screenshot if possible.

Wire consumes a lot of processing resources sitting idle doing nothing. This is a problem that I filed before, and is made worse when timed messages are present. For me it's to the point of choosing to quit wire because it's killing the laptop battery, or run wire and let it kill the laptop battery and so not be able to run anything.

Obviously this is not a good choice and you have some significant design issues to overcome.

This situation should never happen as shown below where there are no messages and Wire is consuming significant power resources. Even if there are timed messages, idle apps should not suck processor. Running timers is not significantly CPU draining if they are implemented correctly. If you implement them poorly they can suck a lot of power and cycles which is what seems to be the case.

Install iStat Menus in order to track processor usage and get battery drain reports.

I found this source code confusingly written (and downright scary at times) and the [specification](https://toktok.github.io/spec) woefully underspecified and inexplicit, so it's entirely possible my understanding of the handshake is _inaccurate_. But on the off-chance that 5 minutes of source code review at 4am yielded something accurate, here is my understanding of the handshake:

Peer A (Alice) has the longterm static keypair `(S_A^{pub}, S_A^{priv})`. Peer A has the session-generated ephemeral keypair `(E_A^{pub}, E_A^{priv})`. Peer B (Bob) has the longterm static keypair `(S_B^{pub}, S_B^{priv})`. Peer B has the session-generated ephemeral keypair `(E_B^{pub}, E_B^{priv})`.

Message 1: A -> B
```
XAEAD(key=ECDH(S_A^{priv}, S_B^{pub}), payload=E_A^{pub})
```

Message 2: B -> A
```
XAEAD(key=ECDH(S_B^{priv}, S_A^{pub}), payload=E_B^{pub})
```

Session Key Derivation
```
ECDH(E_A^{priv}, E_B^{pub}) = ECDH(E_B^{priv}, E_A^{pub})
```

Is this an accurate representation of the handshake? If so, keep reading. If not, you may safely stop reading here, close the issue, and accept my apologies for the misunderstanding.

The issue is that this naive handshake is vulnerable to key-compromise impersonation, something that basically all modern authenticated key exchanges (AKEs) are designed to protect against. Concretely, the issue is that if A's longterm static private key is stolen, an attacker can impersonate anybody to A without A realizing. Let's say that Mallory, M, has stolen A's private key and wants to pretend to be B:

Message 1: M -> A
```
XAEAD(key=ECDH(S_A^{priv}, S_B^{pub}), payload=E_M^{pub})
```

Message 2: A -> M
```
XAEAD(key=ECDH(S_A^{priv}, S_B^{pub}), payload=E_A^{pub})
```

Session Key Derivation
```
ECDH(E_A^{priv}, E_M^{pub}) = ECDH(E_M^{priv}, E_A^{pub})
```

A now thinks he is talking to B, but is actually talking to M.

Perhaps Tox doesn't care about this, or about many of the threat models that modern AKEs are designed to protect against, in which case, probably it's fine to continue using your homebrewed crypto. But if you actually desire some kind of high assurance security, I strongly recommend not building your own protocols and instead use something designed by an educated expert, such as [Noise](http://noiseprotocol.org/).

This is just what immediately leaped out at me after a few short minutes of review. I haven't even begun to look at key derivation and other interesting aspects (are you guys really just using raw ECDH results as keys?).

Again, apologies if this doesn't actually represent the handshake you're using; I'm not 100% certain. But in case it does, then let this be a wake-up call to developers not to roll your own crypto, as well as a wake-up call to users not to rely on crypto software written by non-experts.","2017-01-13T15:20:37Z","2017-10-02T23:46:18Z","https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/426",64,4.722272,"zx2c4","https://api.github.com/repos/TokTok/c-toxcore","usability",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"46",21365254,"open","Prototype encrypting data client-side with the system's public key","Right now as I understand it, the source uploads a sensitive document, that document is sent over Tor to the hidden service running on the source server, that source server encrypts the document, and it is only decrypted on the SVS. This means that if the source server is somehow compromised, an attacker could recover the plaintext of the document before it is encrypted.

Channeling some of the feedback from Patrick Ball at the techno-activism event tonight, it might make sense to instead encrypt on the client with the public key of the system. That way, if the source server is compromised, the data will still be protected, so long as the SVS is secure. Since the SVS has a higher security model than the source server.

The way that was suggested to accomplish this is via a browser extension, or baking keys into the browser. In addition to being a lot of work, this brings up the whole can of worms that comes with key distribution (e.g. does the browser extension/patch server as a CA?)

In the shorter term, one could just provide the public key with Javascript, and encrypt the document using it before sending it to the source server. There are two issues I see with this: first, adding Javascript may open up an attack vector if no Javascript is being used right now. Second, the attacker we've presumed to have control of the source server could modify the Javascript to include a different public key. The second problem I think is solvable with a super basic browser add-on or something that detects when a client sees unexpected Javascript. Not all clients have to run this. Given the attacker does not who has submitted documents, she must attack everyone to attack her target. That means even if a small percentage of people run the testing add-on, it will still make an effective attack (against everyone) detectable.

[There should be a separate bug for if and how to move the conversation with the journalist to use a somewhat similar client-side approach.]

At the time it was determined that the use-case just wasn't there to make it worthwhile.  What with the proliferation of in-browser web-apps it may be time to reconsider.  As an example,  I typically run five to ten different ""applications"" in a web browser that I would like to be addressable from my window manager.   These are things like, email, chat programs, ticketing systems, management tools and more - all of which run inside a browser.   

To accomplish this there are a few options:

1. Run seperate browser instances
This works - especially when coupled with something like electron and nativefier where each instance can have its own name and properties.  The trouble is that each of these instances is a huge resource hog.   Running more than six or seven of these at the same time will bring a quad-core system with 16g of RAM to its knees.   This makes it not really feasable at any sort of scale.

2) Attempt to address the individual applications by their `title` properties.  
This also works -  most of the time.  Unfortunately, the usability of this entirely depends on the websites you are using.  Browsers typically modify the window title based on the page you are on.  Some web pages, like google inbox, will maintain a fairly consistent set of window titles, while others, like the AWS console, don't.   This makes addressing based on `title` error-prone at best and broken at worst.   

I know that in the past the opinion has been that the application author needs to fix their application, and that being unable to use class, title, instance or other window properties is a broken behavior.   However, I think that since the landscape has changed in the direction that it has, and since we are using the same ""binary"" (web browser) to access multiple ""applications"" (web pages) it may be beneficial to provide some funcationality for this use-case.

"52",28438095,"closed","Choice of security presets during setup","If we want TextSecure to compete with W**_sapp, F_book and other less privacy/security focused apps and plattforms, it has to be as user friendly as them. And it should be. Otherwise it'll never get a significant market share with the average users.
But we also want to provide maximum security for people who depend on it with their lives, maybe because they live in an undemocratic country and have an unpopular opinion, maybe because they are protesting the regime in Syria, maybe they are gay and happen to live in Uganda or any of the other 82 coutries where that can get you in jail or even executed.

As TextSecure is supposed to be secure **and** user friendly there are going to be more and more cases where we will have to decide on a default behaviour, often between the safer and the more convenient option.
Many of the convenient features, which many users want, because they know and love them from W**_sapp, F_book and other less privacy/security focused apps and plattforms leak data, which, in some really bad cases, could lead to people getting hurt or worse.

An example would be a notification popup with the message content like #798 requests. In some cases even mentioning the sender alone can be a threat (#308 and #366).
It gets really bad if this can even happen on a locked phone (#198).

If we neither want to force the average user to go deep into the advanced settings to manually activate all the features they expect (really bad usability) nor want to endanger some users by choosing insecure but convenient defaults, we should ask the user at the setup level what their use case is:
- casual user
- moderately security concious user
- tinfoilhat™ / protester in $nodemocracyhere 

Based on their choice we'll set default settings for the above mentioned features, as well as security features like #175, #226 and #328 and future convenience features.

It should also be possible to re-run this from the advanced settings.

One of the most important presets for the paranoid mode would be to turn off SMS messages entirely, because the metadata, which is the most important tool in modern surveillance, can't be hidden. The network providers can also easily scan the traffic and find out who uses TS, which will put people at risk.

With data that problem doesn't exist, because the relay (GCM) probably isn't controlled by the ""enemy"" and it works like an anonymizing proxy, because lots of normal apps use GCM.
As long as HTTPS (TLS) isn't broken (again...), data should be safe.

1. Update Telegram
2. Have wide enough window
3. Suffer from a huge sticker panel.

**UPDATE**: Just noticed already reported and marked as ""invalid"". This is not obvious way to disable panel. Either should be signaled better or put into general settings as well.

### Expected behaviour
There should be option to disable that behavior of sticker panel, as not everyone uses them in the first place.
**Update**: This option should be:
1. Better signalled to user, as expecting him to magically know that clicking the small ""smile"" icon will revert behavior to default is bad idea.
2. Be in the general settings, as that's the first place where user would search for a way to disable panel.

### Actual behaviour
There is no way of disabling sticker panel other than making window smaller.
**Update**: There is way to disable it, but it is completely not obvious.

- Get Bible versions from SWORD

Any others??? Once we get these initial features, we can think about others, like notes, verse of the day, audio Bibles, extra resources (dictionary, etc).

For UI designs, I've set up a page in the wiki (https://github.com/uBible/uBible/wiki/Designs) to host them, along with some useful links to guidelines for Ubuntu Touch. Make sure all UIs follow the guidelines!

"64",30868128,"open","Support for file encryption (e.g. non-trusted servers)","So I have had a look at BitTorrent sync, syncthing and alternatives and what I always wondered about was the possibility to not only sync between resources I own and trust, but also external resources/servers which I do NOT trust with my data, up to a certain extent.

One way to do this is using ecryptfs or encfs, but this has many obvious downsides: it is not an interoperable solution (only works on Linux), the files are actually stored in encrypted form on the disk (even if the resource is trusted and this is not necessary, for instance because of the file system being encrypted already), etc.

What I propose is somehow configuring nodes which are only sent the files in an encrypted format, with all file contents (and potentially file/directory names as well; or even permissions) being encrypted. This way, if I want to store my private files on a fast server in a datacenter to access them from anywhere, I could do this with syncthing without essentially giving up ownership of those files. I could also prevent that particular sync node from being allowed/able to make any changes to the files without me noticing.

I realize that this requires a LOT of additional effort, but it would be a killer feature that seems to not be available in any other ""private cloud"" solution so far. What are your thoughts on this feature?

EDIT: BitTorrent sync mentions a feature like this in their API docs: ""Encryption secret
API users can generate folder secrets with encrypted peer support. Encryption secrets are read-only. They make Sync data encrypted on the receiver’s side. Recipients can sync files, but they can’t see file content, and they can’t modify the files. Encryption secrets come in handy if you need to sync to an untrusted location.""

"66",217092195,"closed","Conversion of KeeFox to WebExtensions","Per the [Milestones schedule](https://github.com/kee-org/browser-addon/milestones) on this repository, the bulk of all efforts until the release of version 2.0 will be on ensuring that we can get something vaguely resembling KeeFox 1.6 to run in Firefox 57+ (and Google Chrome, etc.)

That means re-writing the add-on to use [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/What_are_WebExtensions).

I've made a good start by pulling over some code snippets from KeeFox 1.6 and piecing them together in a way that has resulted in the current ""pre-alpha"" version having the following broadly working:

- Basic add-on architecture (build, default config, logging to console)
- Connection from add-on to the existing KeePassRPC plugin version
- Rendering state of connection on a browser button/icon on the browser toolbar
- Detection of forms on web pages
- Sending request to find matching logins and receiving list of logins in the web page

The lists below will be expanded as we delve into more detail and see how the WebExtensions API evolves over the next 6 months. With some luck we might be able to implement some items from the ""uncertain"" list although it's also likely other features will be added to the two lists.

### Functionality we are unable to retain

- Assisted KeePass installation and configuration (prohibited by WebExtensions)
- Some customised keyboard shortcut keys (it should be possible for each user to manually re-configure them though)
- Logging to files (prohibited by WebExtensions)
- Protecting the KeePassRPC authentication token with the Firefox master password (prohibited by WebExtensions)

### Functionality we are unlikely to retain (either too much work or uncertain technical viability)

- Some customised keyboard shortcut keys (we probably won't migrate the current settings but some keyboard shortcuts that relate to specific web pages can be supported if we have time)
- Launching KeePass from within Firefox (launching executables is banned although if a user were to install a hypothetical ""KeeFox helper"" executable we might be able to get something to work but it is unlikely that will exist on most user's systems so this work goes to the bottom of the priority list)
- Multi-page logins (the code that will deal with filling and saving passwords gets created and destroyed on every page load, making this a technically difficult problem to solve)
- Some assistive UI (e.g. new user advice, tips, security warnings). Things like ""Save/update password?"" should be possible in some form but may suffer from reduced usability
- Usage metrics (this is useful for planning how to improve KeeFox but with limited control over the changes we are making for version 2.0, a reduction in the number of platforms running version 2.0 and a lack of time to analyse and act on the limited data we could collect, it's not worthwhile initially)
- HTTP Auth/Proxy/Windows Auth dialog box filling and saving (not possible to modify the dialog box, other more-limited approaches could work if we have time though)

Please feel free to comment or ask questions below.

"67",161112784,"open","Proposal: DOMChangeList","# `DOMChangeList` and `DOMTreeConstruction`
## Motivation

There are three high-level motivations for this API:
1. To make it clearer and less error prone to apply a sequence of DOM operations at once, that can support the full gamut of mutations to `Element`s and `Node`s.
2. For efficiency, to provide an API for constructing a sequence of DOM operations that can be:
   1. constructed in a worker and transferred to the UI thread
   2. constructed with a minimum of allocations
   3. applied in one shot without interleaved user code
3. To support, in one API, the superset of trees that can be produced using the HTML parser and using the DOM API (the HTML parser supports more tag names, while the DOM API supports more trees, such as custom elements nested inside a table).

> This is an initial, minimal version of this API, which could be expanded over time with more capabilities. It should always maintain its goals of predictable, allocation-lite performance, focusing on giving user-space abstractions the capabilities they need for maximum performance.
# Concepts
## NodeToken

A `NodeToken` is an opaque value that represents a `Node`. It can be efficiently transferred from one worker to another.

It serves two purposes:
- To represent a `Node` that already exists in another worker, and can serve as the starting point of a series of mutations expressed in a `DOMChangeList`.
- To represent an intermediate `Node` that was produced as part of the process of building a `DOMChangeList`.
## Applying a Change

The intent of this API is to have these performance characteristics:
- Creating a change list (`DOMTreeConstruction` or `DOMChangeList`) significantly reduces GC-managed allocations compared to the current DOM APIs.
- Applying a change list should not create intermediate JavaScript wrappers for the DOM objects it creates, which should reduce costs.
- It is possible to run the JavaScript code necessary to construct a change list in a worker, and apply it on the UI thread with minimal additional work or allocations in JavaScript.
- The API creates a single immutable blob of instructions to pass to the engine, which is intended to avoid JavaScript side effects while the application proceeds. (as [Boris Zbarsky said](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11780060) in his comment about proposals in this space, ""that would simplify both specification and implementation (in the sense of not having to spell out a specific processing algorithm, allowing parallelized implementation, etc)."")
- It is reasonable to assume that the builder APIs could be exposed to WebAssembly.

If there is some reason that a concrete implementation of this design might not be able to accomplish these goals, it's almost certainly something we should discuss.
# Details
## DOMTreeConstruction

> Note: Use of TypeScript generics notation in the details of this proposal does not intend to imply any additional type checking. It is simply a way to annotate which kinds of node a particular node tokens is intended to produce for clarity. This proposal expects checking at the point of application (e.g. appending a node to a non-element node doesn't make sense and would be an error at the time of application). At present, this proposal does not assume that errors in the change list cause previously applied operations to be rolled back; that is listed as an open question below.

``` typescript
// you can create a NodeToken in the UI thread and transfer it into
// a worker that constructs the DOMChangeList or DOMTreeConstruction.
partial interface Node {
  getToken(): NodeToken<this>;  
}

interface Bounds {
  firstNode: NodeToken<Node>;
  lastNode: NodeToken<Node>;
}

partial interface Element {
  // this has the same semantics as insertBefore, but takes a `DOMTreeConstruction`
  insertTreeBefore(element: Element, tree: DOMTreeConstruction, reference: Node): Promise<AppliedChanges>;
}

// The intent of this object is to allow engines to clean up any bookkeeping maps they
// need to track `NodeToken`s once the `AppliedChanges` is GCed.
interface AppliedChanges {
  // this allows code that created a ChangeList to get the actual
  // node they were creating so they can add listeners or change
  // the node later.
  getNode<T extends Node>(t: NodeToken<T>): T;
}

// DOMTreeConstruction is transferrable, and is backed by raw bytes. This
// allows trees to be constructed in workers.
interface DOMTreeConstruction {
  openElement(name: string, ns: string = ""html""): NodeToken<Element>;
  closeElement();

  setAttribute(name: string, value: string = """", ns: string = """"): void;
  appendText(text: string): NodeToken<Text>;
  appendComment(text: string): NodeToken<Comment>;
  appendHTML(html: string): Bounds;
}
```
## DOMChangeList

``` typescript
partial interface Document {
  applyChanges(changes: DOMChangeList): Promise<AppliedChanges>;
}

// DOMChangeList is transferrable, and is backed by raw bytes. This
// allows change lists to be constructed in workers.
interface DOMChangeList {
  /// traverse
  nextSibling(n: NodeToken<Node>): NodeToken<Node | null>;
  previousSibling(n: NodeToken<Node>): NodeToken<Node | null>;
  firstChild(n: NodeToken<Node>): NodeToken<Node | null>;
  lastChild(n: NodeToken<Node>): NodeToken<Node | null>;
  parentNode(n: NodeToken<Node>): NodeToken<Element | null>;

  /// create
  createElement(name: string, ns: string = 'html'): NodeToken<Element>;
  createText(text: string): NodeToken<Text>;
  createComment(text: string): NodeToken<Comment>;

  /// update
  setAttribute(el: NodeToken<Element>, name: string, value: string = '', ns: string = ''): void;
  updateTextData(n: NodeToken<Text>, text: string): void;
  updateCommentData(n: NodeToken<Comment>, text: string): void;
  remove(n: NodeToken<Node>): void;

  /// append
  appendChild(el: NodeToken<Element>, node: NodeToken<Node>): void;
  appendTree(el: NodeToken<Element>, tree: DOMTreeConstruction): void;

  // this unifies the various HTML-based APIs in the DOM; the return value is
  // a token corresponding to the start and a token corresponding to the end of
  // the inserted tree which can be reified after application.
  //
  // IMPORTANT NOTE: The HTML is parsed during application, not when
  // it is added to the change list.
  insertHTMLBefore(node: NodeToken<Node>, html: string): [NodeToken, NodeToken];
}
```
# Example

Using the usual DOM API:

``` javascript
let article = document.getElementById('main-article');
let text = node.firstChild;
text.textValue = ""Hello world"";
node.setAttribute(""data-active"", ""yes"");
node.removeAttribute(""data-pending"");
```

Using the ChangeList API:

``` javascript
let articleToken = document.getToken(document.getElementById('main-article'));

let changes = new DOMChangeList();
let textToken = changes.firstChild(token);
changes.updateTextData(textToken, ""Hello world"");
changes.setAttribute(articleToken, ""data-active"", ""yes"");
changes.removeAttribute(articleToken, ""data-pending"");

document.applyChanges(changes);
```
# FAQ
### Is this actually faster?
1. Don't you still have to create all of the DOM nodes anyway? If so, why is it cheaper?
2. Isn't DOM pretty fast in modern browsers already?

The intent of this API is to create a low-level interface that is as close as possible to the underlying implementations. It attempts to avoid introducing new costs while reducing a number of paper-cuts that exist in today's usage.
1. This API creates DOM nodes in the engine, but it does not need to create JavaScript wrappers. Experiments with deep `cloneNode` show that skipping those wrappers provides a performance benefit, but `cloneNode()` can't satisfy as many use-cases as this API.
2. It allows the construction of the set of mutations to occur separately from the application (or even in a worker), keeping the sensitive work that limits 60fps to a minimum.
3. Since applying changes is asynchronous, the full change list can be applied in batches that avoid blocking interaction (especially scroll). If the browser reaches its budget, it can interleave some work to keep the UI interactive and pick up the mutation process afterward. In short, the API should allow browsers to experiment with more scheduling strategies.
4. It encourages good staging practices, eliminating some of the major causes of layout thrash (see the next section).
### Isn't the real issue that people are interleaving DOM manipulation and layout?

That is certainly a major issue, and this API puts developers on the path to success by encouraging them to stage DOM manipulation work separately from APIs that can trigger painting or layout.

Because the API guarantees that no user script can interleave during the application of changes, there is no way to ""mess up"" and trigger an immediate flush of any deferred work.
# Unresolved Questions
1. The current state of this API allows failures to occur during the processing of a change list, and does not require engines to roll back earlier changes (rolling back changes like ""remove an iframe"" may not be trivial to implement). Would engines prefer to roll back changes?
2. Should we support APIs like `ClassList` and the `style` property through this API? It may be difficult to represent these kinds of changes with the operations already proposed (since this API does not allow direct imperative access to the DOM), and a few additional APIs probably wouldn't do damage to the constraints.
3. Are there other optimizations that could be performed by engines? For example, Luke Wagner suggested that a parameterized version of this API could work like ""prepared statements"" in SQL, allowing engines to do up-front work to optimize the access and mutation patterns for application. What can we do to make this API more hospitable to hypothetical optimizations like those?

The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) is a web application that enables the creation and sharing of executable documents which contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Thanks to a modular design, Jupyter can be used with any computational system that provides a so-called [_Jupyter kernel_](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/kernels.html) implementing the [_Jupyter messaging protocol_](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to communicate with the notebook. OpenDreamKit therefore promotes the Jupyter notebook as user interface of choice, in particular since it is particularly suitable for building modular web based Virtual Research Environments.

A notebook interface is such a vital integrative component that, predating Jupyter, the open source mathematical system SageMath had developed as early as 2005 its own solution, which we refer to here as the legacy SageMath notebook. Development was fast tracked to ensure its availability to allow the project to move forward, and it served as major source of inspiration for Jupyter.  Meanwhile, moving at a fast pace thanks to its much larger community, Jupyter had, by 2014, basically caught up with the legacy SageMath notebook in terms of functionality. 

Building on top of D4.4 (#93): Basic Jupyter interface for GAP, PARI/GP, SageMath, Singular, the goal of this deliverable was therefore to help phase out the legacy SageMath notebook in favour of Jupyter. Outsourcing this key but non disciplinary component is an important step toward the sustainability of ODK's ecosystem (Objective 5).

Since 2014, a lot of work was put into this by the SageMath community, and in particular by Volker Braun. Recently, this work has been continued thanks to ODK. It included two aspects: ensuring that Jupyter included all important features of the legacy SageMath notebook, and enabling a smooth migration path for users:

We're seeing really inconsistent extrusion, beyond the moire effect that we were trying to fix with linearity correction. Do you know if they are related? I have tested a 40mm single wall cube with no infill, then cut it with scissors. Within a single wall on a single later, I have found my extrusion width getting wider/narrower (and only one extrusion command in the gcode for the entire wall). I also confirmed that where it becomes fatter happens on both the outside and the inside of the print, so this doesn't seem to be X/Y related.

Many people on the forums are also seeing the same thing, here's some of the images. Looking at it straight on, the prints look fine and Z height seems to be fine. When you shine light down from above, the fatter lines cast shadows and it looks pretty rough.

Type: DApp / Bot 
Github Repo: https://github.com/Nielsvdiermen/WhoPays
Video: https://vimeo.com/221149759

**Description:**
WhoPays is a bot made for the status Hackathon. It is an Ethereum blockchain decentralized payment solution for managing and solving expenses for groups of people. If you are on holiday, planning a project or living together you can make a list with everyone and add expenses. When you want to calculate the balance of everyone, the contract will do that for you. It will inform who still has to pay and who receives money. After everyone has paid, the contract will pay out to the people still owing money and the list will be closed.
 
A video of how it works can be found here: https://vimeo.com/221149759
 
**Starting Design Description:**
A contract-based bot to create groups in which users can keep track of their payments for a group through commands with a new chatbot.
 
Use cases:
- When people go on vacation with a group of people and everybody pays some parts of the vacation (dinner, going out, events)
- A group of people living together where individuals buy groceries for the whole group
- You’re planning an event (lets say bachelor party!) and the friends who you’re organizing it with have multiple different expenses e.g. gas usage, food, drinks.
 
In essence it is a simple way for friends to keep track of who paid what during a trip, holiday or other period of time. 
 
Users can add and resolve payments through status commands which get send to a contract on the blockchain.  At the end of a duration when the contract needs to be resolved the creator can use a command to close the contract. The contract will calculate how much each user has to pay or receive. The contract will let the Status app know how much each user has to pay and can create Ether requests for this. When everyone has added their payments to the contract, the contract will send Ether to the users who still have to receive some. After that the contract is resolved.

**What we would like to improve:**
Working with Status was difficult at times because the app is still quite new and is still being developed on multiple fronts. One of the biggest things we would like to improve in our project to really reach its full potential is the ability to simply add users to a list by selecting them in the address book. Right now we have to manually input Ether addresses and this is very user-unfriendly. What also is needed is the ability to automatically send messages to people in the list that they have joined the list. Right now users have to copy the contract hash to the other members of the list and manually join the list with the /join command and the hash. 
 
While we really like Status and how it gives many new possibilities in the world of blockchain applications we feel that for this technology to grow there needs to a better link  between cryptocurrency and “real” money. For WhoPays everything is Ether based so the user has to calculate how much Ether he/she has paid. A way to calculate between the currencies and automatically calculate it into the current Ether amount would be very welcome.

We would have loved to make the bot available in a group chat, so that every user can see who paid for what and there would be less traffic. The way this could work is to create a group with the people you want in the list and add the bot to the group. The bot would then create the list by commands and everyone can see what is being paid and what the current expense balance is.

The problem is that the carrier intercepted the activation SMS and set up new devices for one's account.

Signal seems to have the same vulnerability, maybe worse, since there doesn't seem to be a way to add a password to an account (which Telegram has). There should be a way to better protect users in countries where the government and the carrier cannot be trusted.

Some progress has been made (#1480), but the more I think about it, the more I wonder if the warning just shouldn't be there at all -- or rather, replaced with something else.

It's no question that setting the security slider to High reduces the browser attack surface. But this is just one small piece of advice out of a myriad of other advice we could give, and I don't think it's even the most important. A much more important piece of advice, for example, is ""don't tell anyone that you're a source."" Or we could tell sources to use Tails or Whonix. Or we could tell them not to use SD from work, and to always use it on a personal computer.

In this context, the scary red warning bar that's specifically about Javascript seems a bit arbitrary.

![screenshot_2017-02-07_11-43-15](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/156128/22708336/b75af25a-ed2a-11e6-950f-df7bf455e01b.png)

Also, I'm not convinced it's always sound advice -- there are downsides to setting the slider to High, like it makes many websites completely break, which might be confusing and challenging for people. I obviously don't have data on this, but I suspect that most SecureDrop sources use Tor Browser for submitting to SD, and that's it. When this is the case, the only actor in a position to hack the source using a JS-based Tor Browser exploit is the journalist org that's running the SD server, or someone who hacks that server, and that's it. (Disabling JS is more useful for people who use Tor Browser for email services like SIGAINT that they actively use, or are regulars on forums or markets, or run a twitter account.)

Maybe the red warning bar should be completely removed, and instead that can just be a link in the footer to https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/source.html (or maybe a new documentation page, or maybe one hosted within the SD website to avoid referrer headers) where it describes various tips and tricks for staying secure as a source.","2017-02-07T20:02:40Z","2017-03-02T22:14:45Z","https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues/1566",12,0.0706518,"micahflee","https://api.github.com/repos/freedomofpress/securedrop","usability",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Running multiple IM programs with different UI, different notification, separate contact lists, well, sucks. This is compounded by the fact that initially only very few people on our contact lists would be on ricochet/invisible.im. And don't forget about mobile phones... all in all, I would much prefer a libpurple plugin than a standalone GUI application (I normally use bitlbee for IM).

"210",146343144,"closed","Create intro email blast for All-MoFo","## Introducing Mozilla Chat

tl;dr: Join us at https://chat.mozillafoundation.org/. Native apps available in ""How to Join"" below.

We've all used many chat clients here at Mozilla. There’s IRC, Skype, Google Chat, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Minigroups, not to mention good old-fashioned email. Each has its own strengths yet all of them combined create a weakness in the organization’s communication, with teams scattered across these services. These tools have a variety of unique features, but there seem to be a common subset of functional and ideological goals that align with those of Mozilla.

As we search for the right tool, the Engineering and Design teams have been evaluating Mattermost, an open source Slack-alternative–we can all just call it, ""Chat"". We’ve used it for a few months, contributed some code, and worked out the major usability bugs. Now we’d like to invite the rest of the Foundation to try it out and let us know what you think.
#### Goals of chat software
- Be open and promote inclusivity
- Reduce the need for emails
- Enable access to conversations at any time on any device (not just while online)
- Offer ability to manage conversations across projects and reduce the need for meetings.
#### Useful features of Chat
- Messaging and files
- Send messages and comments across public, private, and 1:1 channels
- Personalize notifications
- Share files and images
- Archiving and search
- Search all channels for past messages and comments
- View recent mentions of your name, username, nickname, and custom search terms
- Receive messages even if you’re offline
- Embeddable Gif support
#### How to join

Visit https://chat.mozillafoundation.org and sign up. (It’s not integrated with any existing accounts, yet.)

You can keep it in a browser tab, but you might find it more helpful to download a native app:
1. Download for your platform
   - [OSX](https://github.com/mattermost/desktop/releases/download/v1.1.0/mattermost-desktop-1.1.0-osx.tar.gz)
   - 64-bit [Windows](https://github.com/mattermost/desktop/releases/download/v1.1.0/mattermost-desktop-1.1.0-win64.zip)
   - Other Desktop releases available [here](https://github.com/mattermost/desktop/releases)
2. Install/Copy the Mattermost executable to your Applications folder.
3. If Mac OS gives you an “unsigned developer” warning while opening the app, ctrl-click on the app and click open.
4. Enter Team: `Mozilla`, URL: `https://chat.mozillafoundation.org`
5. Create an account or log in.

Mobile apps are available for iOS and Android

Once you're in, you can give feedback in the Mozilla Chat Dev channel.
#### Notifications:

Notifications can be customized on an account level and a channel level. 
- Account Level: Click the menu icon in the top left corner next to your username and check out “Account Settings”.
- Channel level: when in a channel, click the name of it at the top and look at notification preferences. You might want to disable unread notifications for certain channels unless you’re specifically mentioned.

It would be really great if we could properly typecheck attribute declarations. Currently, attributes are read/written via `getAttribute('name')` and `setAttribute('name', $val)`. This isn't typeable as-is since the return type of `getAttribute` depends on its name. We have few options here, in order from my preferred to least preferred:
- Move attributes from an array in the XHP superclasses into an `stdClass`; they would then be accessed through `$this->attributes->name`. We'd add a tiny special case to the typechecker to know what all the fields of `$this->attributes` are. Benefit: changes are pretty minor in XHP superclasses (`stdClass` behaves largely like an array), we can keep the old `getAttribute` methods for backwards compat (and to allow FB www to slowly convert as we get things to typecheck properly), IDE autocomplete just falls out. Downside: I don't see much?
- Special-case `getAttribute` etc in the typechecker. If we require a constant string as an argument, we can know the type and do the right thing. Benefit: requires no changes to PHP code anywhere. Downside: IDE autocomplete for attributes will have to be more special case code.
- Move attributes to be protected members directly on the XHP classes. Still need a typechecker special case to convert the `attribute` declaration into members. Benefit: really nice client API -- `$this->attributeName`. Downside: probably impossible to cleanly convert since XHP classes might use attributes with conflicting names, similarly impossible to cleanly enumerate for something like `transferAttributes`.

It will probably be a few weeks at the earliest before I can get around to any of this, but just wanted to have the issue open for discussion to make sure the approach was good.

"68",148053872,"closed","Proposal for beating WhatsApp and supporting open communication","Also see https://github.com/redsolution/xabber-android/issues/634

This is not an issue in the existing version - more a proposal how we may get Jabber/XMPP to become a **real** alternative to WhatsApp, since I fear that people now think WhatsApp is ""good"" and ""secure"" as it introduced end-to-end-encryption. But with WhatsApp people are still depending on one single company - Facebook. And this should not continue like this. But just telling people, they should move to Jabber doesn't really help since many users find Jabber too complicated and only suitable for ""tech-savvy geeks"".

_What makes WhatsApp so popular?_

Well - you don't need to create any account using a username/password and you don't need to know the account names of your friends - their phone numbers are enough to check, if they use WhatsApp as well and to reach them. And as you already have the numbers in your phonebook you literally can start to chat with your friends instantly after installing WhatsApp.

_How to achieve the same goal with XMPP/Jabber?_

My idea:

1) Offer to enter an existing account OR to create an account using one of several well known Jabber providers (e.h. jabber.org, jabber.de etc.) with a password which is automatically created locally and which can be displayed or saved for later reference. The list of providers could be loaded dynamically from a server (see point 3) where providers could register their service.

2) Detect the local phone number and/or allow the user a way to enter and confirm it manually.

3) Provide an online service for a central registry where the client can send the hash the telephone number together with the Jabber-ID.

4) Offer a function where the use can look up existing (hashed) phone numbers at the central registry to see, if others in his addressbook already use the service and if yes which Jabber-ID they have - so you can easily get in touch with others without the need of manually exchanging Jabber-IDs.

I'm aware, that the central registry may be seen as ""evil"" - but this should be implemented as open source and should be run by a non profit organisation. To cover the cost for the servers, backup, maintenance etc. one could either rely on donations or ask for a yearly usage fee by the users with the first 1 to 3 months for free - if a user decides not to pay, the registered hash gets locked with a status ""user does not want to use the service any longer"", so others will not find it any longer. However - communication is still possible, as the central registry is only needed to find others more easily, not for the communication itself. Of course you still can contact Jabber-IDs directly without using a registry server.

It's only a very rough proposal and there may still be things I forgot - but what do you think? Does this sound interesting? Did anyone try this yet?

I've been a professional software developer for the last 20+ years (see [http://arnowelzel.de/wp/en/about-me](http://arnowelzel.de/wp/en/about-me)). I have experience in Android development as well as in running and maintaining Linux servers (I run my own Jabber server as well as a number of domains and services for friends and family members) - so I can help wherever needed. But I don't want to do this without the support of others.

Basically, as-is `depends_on :python` now will use the first Python in your PATH. If this is from Homebrew or the system Python there's slightly different behaviour. It's basically now used to set `PYTHONPATH` correctly and depend on Python if one is needed. Stuff like `scons` that doesn't install any bindings should not have a `depends_on :python` and will, as a result, always use a system Python. This case can be trivially bottled. 

Where it gets complicated is when we want to start bottling either stuff that installs only bindings (e.g. `pyqt`) or stuff where the bindings are currently (and, sensibly should be e.g. `libxml2`) installed by default.

As far as I see it there are several options:
1. `depends_on :python` stuff that's bottled will always use the system Python (the current behaviour). If people want to build against their own Python we tell them to use `--build-from-source`.
2. Same as 1. except if the system Python is not first in their PATH we automatically build from source.
3. `depends_on :python` stuff that's bottled will always use the Homebrew Python and will be built against that. If people want to build against their own or the system Python we tell them to use `--build-from-source`.
4. Same as 3. except if the Homebrew Python is not first in their PATH we automatically build from source.
5. We never build Python bindings by default; they are all made optional.

Perhaps related to the above: we currently assume the system Python is 2.7. If it's found to not be (either someone has fucked around with it or it's an older version of OSX) then we use the Homebrew Python instead of the system one.

My personal preference here is either 1. or 2. I believe @mistydemeo's was either 3. or 4. I'm somewhat opposed to them for the reason that I'd rather not add a Homebrew Python dependency to e.g. `libxml2` just because we want to build the bindings.

If there's any other options here I'm missing, please let me know. @adamv @asparagui @jacknagel @mistydemeo @mxcl @manphiz @samueljohn @chrmoritz @jenshnielsen @daviewales I'd love your thoughts here.

In Cinnamon 1.2 (this didn't happen in 1.1.3) whenever messages are received in Skype and Skype is minimized, Skype comes to the forefront for me and jumps on top of all other open windows. Obviously this isn't behavior we want. In Cinnamon 1.1.3 a notification Window was displayed in the top right, as I recall, if that option was set in Skype. This is ideal behavior. In Gnome Shell Skype also behaves correctly and a notification top center appears telling me a new message is received. 

I've tweaked the chat and notification settings in Skype to just display a notification and not display anything at all. Either way, Skype comes to the forefront. 

Skype should not be coming to the top and I believe it might have something to do with notifications if something was changed on the back end of Cinnamon between 1.1.3 and now, because it did used to work well.

- No support for full set of configuration options (e.g., explicit setting of hostname / port, with a fantastic summary by @SafwatHalaby on #962, there are also other issues concerning TLS use, etc.)
- Multiple support requests on the bugtracker, and subsequent complaints (including my own at #1196)

For anyone using Celsius on your Ecobee Thermostat I just want to let you know of what that'll do to your thermostat. **It's still usable, but you need to understand how it works:**
1. Your Thermostat will show you the readings in Celsius, but the sensors will be in Fahrenheit.
2. If you change the temperature it'll send the commands in Fahrenheit. So, if you change the temperature with the up arrow it'll do the following:
   1. Let's pretend that the display reads 21 degrees (that's in Celsius) and we are working with 'heat' mode only.
   2. You press the up arrow
   3. It'll tell your Ecobee to go to 22 decrees but commands are in Fahrenheit, so it's telling your Ecobee to go to 22 Fahrenheit. Typically the Ecobee has a minimum set temp and so it'll go to that (for me it's 15 degrees Celsius.) So although you wanted it to be 22 Celsius, it's now set to 15.
   4. So basically, don't use the arrows
3. If you use the 'home', 'away' routines, or any other smartapps that set the temperature of your ecobee, make sure to set the temperatures you type in are in Fahrenheit otherwise it'll do the same thing as in issue 2.
4. The dials on the bottom of the screen (where you can set cool, or heat with a linear dial:
   1. It read out in Celsius, but again sets the temp in Fahrenheit.
   2. So if you want to change the temperature, use these dials, but you need to convert whatever you are setting it to. (move the dial to 72 if you want the house to be heated to 22 Celsius)
   3. When you set the temperature using those dials, they will then stay in Fahrenheit  until you press the 'refresh' icon.

**If you remember to convert properly, the devices and SmartApps should work just fine with the code as is, until someone updates it to handle Celsius properly.**

Below is a proposal draft. Please comment / amend as you see fit:

Title of devroom:
Open source design

Elaborate description of proposed devroom (including possible topics):
The first open source design devroom last year was a success, with a healthy number of proposals submitted and great attendance. We would like to repeat this year. The goal of this devroom is to showcase design work done within free and open source projects, and strengthen the connections between designers involved in FOSS. We mean ""design"" in a broad sense, and we include within that term typography, graphic design, interaction design, user experience and design research activities. 

Possible topics include:
- FOSS design tools
- Design techniques and deliverables
- Design - engineering collaboration approaches
- User engagement and design research activities 
- Project case studies 

After receiving several requests, we will probably dedicate an hour to project pitches, so that projects looking for design contributions can introduce themselves and establish contact with designers eager to help. 

Why does it fit FOSDEM?
FOSS projects bring in particular challenges that affect almost every aspect of design. Techniques and approaches used in closed software settings must be re-purposed and adapted to FOSS. This is hard to do on your own. We hope that sharing experiences across projects and communities will help establish a set of practices that are effective, flexible and transferable across FOSS projects. 

The devroom last year also proved to be a great way of connecting designers with FOSS projects looking for design contributors.

Don't hide it and enable user interaction! 
The only way to get to the contact information of a recipient seems to be:
1. Make sure you are in a group with them
2. Go to the members view via group info overlay
3. Select them in the list

A far more suitable option would be to also have the ""group information"" metaphor in the 1 to 1 chat views.
Signal wouldn't have to hide key verification and the contact information view would be accessible in a appropriate way. The overlay could state something like: [  Call  Verify  More   ]

- Go back to the Inbox pretending you want to start a new conversation and press the call icon

(your input will be lost either way see ""Keep state (keyboard text input)"")
##### Branding < Usability

The Signal icon can't be part of the navigation stack!
This is the first serious iOS project I have seen where the app icon is used in the navigation stack and as view title.
The available main views are the ""Inbox"" and ""Archive"" (or other suitable strings) but not an icon.
_Q: If i have a chat view open already where will I end up if i tap the signal icon back button?_
The navigation stack is not made for having a nice translation only. It's main purpose is providing information about where we're coming from and going to. Otherwise you could use a modal view without a semantic difference.

Another point is the textsecure send icon vs ""Send"" as string but I will bring that up in  #577
##### Keep state (keyboard text input)

It is very disturbing to lose unfinished inputs when switching between chats. While every serious ""competing"" messaging app and the system app keeps it.

- [x] Will we be keeping the IntelliSense for dependency management? This is basically one of the best demo features we have for `project.json`.

I have this feature mostly implemented using

```
document.activeElement;
```

however, if the active element is within an iframe, it returns the reference to the iframe instead of the actual active element. We probably need to use the Firefox API at the extension level to walk into the active iframe and get the active form element or editable div.

This can be implemented by adding a menu to, for example browser.xul:

```
<keyset id=""mainKeyset"">
    <key id=""key_convert"" key=""x"" modifiers=""accel alt"" oncommand=""privlyExtension.keyboardCommand()""/>
</keyset>

Then adding the handler in extension-host-interface which asks for the cursor's current position using document.activeElement, and posts the content.

But the green color has confused myself, @sagischwarz, @phenx-de and literally everybody I have told to install the app. 

@phenx-de and myself have had a rather extensive discussion about the whole shebang in #908.

What we came up with:
- Use orange instead of green
  - Green is widely used to indicate security aka encryption (green traffic light -> you're safe / good to go) and people are used very to it.
  - Green is already used to indicate encryption / TS users in the contact list 
  - It also collides with several ideas in #741 and #910 to indicate trust
  - Orange is the only color left in the Android color scheme, apart from purple: https://developer.android.com/design/style/color.html
  - It doesn't have such a direct association as green and red have
- Use toned down colors to indicate the most likely transport for messages that aren't sent yet (#796)
  - Provides information about the most likely transport
  - Indicates that the message hasn't been send yet
- We should use color strips on a light grey message body. Either on the speakers' side or on top of the messages
  - A whole window of completely colored messages looks very playful/cartoonish
  - It improves the contrast of the gray message-delivered text and icons below the message, making it easier to read
  - Scale down the importance of the transport information to a reasonable level 
- Color both the messages of sender and receiver
  - While roaming and in some countries people have to pay (a lot) for incoming texts, so knowing if it's an SMS or not is important.
  - The current implementation is inconsistent from a UX perspective.

"331",50310923,"closed","Add authentication to prevent MiTM attacks","Currently Tox only prevents against MitM attacks between users if it can be guaranteed that they each have the right Tox ID added. The Tox ID has to be exchanged over a probably insecure channel, which could easily just switch IDs around. This was talked about in IRC and while there's no real world case against this in Tox, here's an example attack:

I tell someone my ID over Twitter. They add it. We're MitMed because their ISP was compromised. I have no way of knowing this on my end. This is analogous to trusting certificate authorities to give you valid site certificates.

Next time we tell each other's IDs over IRC so we can check better. Unfortunately their insecure IRC is attacked by their compromised ISP and changes their ID recieves and my ID recieving. We're MitMed. I haven't seen an attack like this in the wild, but I can easily imagine it happening in email, especially as more and more people move to PGP.

We tell each other's Tox IDs over phone which we assume can't be MitMed due to voice prints. No MitMing can happen.

If Tox is meant to be passed as private messaging, there needs to be a better way to ensure it actually is private by authenticating people, and in a friendly manner.

I suggest friend requests are turned in to two-step procedure, by adding a shared secret and required message from both ends.

Alice would send a friend request, asking Bob when they first met. Bob sends his answer back, along with a question of his own, asking her which animal he's feared most. Alice verifies the answer and either sends back a rejection, or an approval and an answer to Bob's question. If Alice gets the question right, they add each other as they have the correct IDs.

"341",51805978,"closed","ServiceWorkerClient to Client","These shouldn't be specific to ServiceWorker, and should move into the Fetch spec.

These bits stay the same:

```
partial interface ServiceWorkerGlobalScope : WorkerGlobalScope {
  readonly attribute ServiceWorkerClients clients;
}

interface ServiceWorkerClients {
  Promise<sequence<Client>> getAll(optional ServiceWorkerClientQueryParams params);
}

dictionary ServiceWorkerClientQueryParams {
  // include clients on the origin that aren't controlled by this SW
  boolean includeUncontrolled;
}
```

Here's the different bits:

```
enum ClientType { ""window"", ""worker"", ""sharedworker"", ""serviceworker"" };

dictionary ClientOptions {
  ClientType type = ""window"";
};

[Constructor(USVString url, optional ClientOptions options), Exposed=Window, Worker]
interface Client {
  readonly attribute Promise<void> update;
  readonly attribute VisibilityState visibilityState;
  readonly attribute boolean focused;
  readonly attribute USVString url;
  readonly attribute ContextFrameType frameType;
  readonly attribute ClientType type;
  readonly attribute ServiceWorkerRegistration? serviceWorkerRegistration;
  void postMessage(any message, optional sequence<Transferable> transfer);
  Promise<void> focus();
}
```

The properties of a client do not change after construction unless **update** is called.

The **constructor** takes a `url` and `options`. The options are a bit useless at the moment, as it should throw if `type` is set to anything other than `window`. If `type` is `window` (the default), the user agent is requested to open a new tab/window. This may depend on a user-interaction event, as `window.open` does now.

**update** causes `visibilityState`, `focused`, `url`, and `serviceWorkerRegistration` to refresh to the client's current values. If the client hasn't yet succeeded/failed to open, it waits. It rejects if the client is no longer running, or failed to ever run. It doubles as a ready method. **Question**: Do we need a ready method regardless?

**visibilityState** is from [Page Visibility](http://www.w3.org/TR/page-visibility/#VisibilityState). It reports `hidden` for non-window types.

**focused** is the result of `hasFocus()` from the [focus management APIs](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focus-management-apis). **Question**: Or should it be true if the browser window has focus and the containing tab is active? As in, should it be true for a top-level client if a contained client (such as an iframe) has focus? Should it be true for a frame in a frameset even if focus is in one of the other frames in the frameset? Should it be true for a top-level client if docked devtools has focus?

**url** is the current url of the client. This is the script url for workers, but can change throughout the life of a window via hash changes and `pushState`. **Question**: Or should this be the creation url, therefore static for windows too? Once we get `clients.claim()`, it'll be taking over clients based on creation url so `pushState` cannot allow pages to ""jump scope"" and be claimed by a registration they otherwise wouldn't be.

**frameType** comes from the [fetch spec](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-context-frame-type). It lets you tell iframes apart from top-level windows.

**type** lets you tell windows apart from different types of worker.

**serviceWorkerRegistration** lets you know if the client is controlled by a worker or not.

**postMessage** does what you'd expect.

**focus** rejects if the type is not ""window"". Calls `window.focus()` on the related window. Resolves if successful, rejects otherwise. This may depend on a user-interaction event. **Question**: Should this implicitly call update?

I thought about having separate constructors rather than a `type` attribute, such as `WindowClient`, `WorkerClient` etc etc, but that means we'd have more constructors that'd throw, and I know how y'all hate that!

- the message is not encrypted

**I haven't tested case 3 and 4 yet (tell me if you want me to).**

**Is there any use in having this function?** If so, could you quickly explain what it's supposed to do and why?
It doesn't really help if two people write via SMS and somehow the session gets messed up - you could just go ahead and end or renew the session via the lock in the top bar.

I would personally like to be able to manually force the use of SMS and several friends asked me if it's implemented already.
For most of them the usecase for that looks like this: The receiver turns off wifi and mobile internet to not be disturbed by instant messages or mails while doing important work. The expectation is, If somebody really needs to contact you, they'll either call or write a text message.
Many people I know use exactly this behaviour at work and others know that.
So when it's working hours, the other one doesn't immediately reply to your push messages, and you have to contact them, forcing TS to send an SMS is the next best option.
No need for TS to know if they are offline (#677, #678)

Currently near consensus has been reached in these issues about implementing a visual security model in TS: #910, #945, #766 and #741. In my oppinion this model has some problems which I'd like discuss here and propose a different model. I created this issue because right now there is no chance to change the course of the discussion in the mentioned issues. So I chose to not interfere any further, let the participants improve their model and work on an alternative model separately. 
### II. Criticism of the proposed model

This is the visual model as proposed in the aforementioned issues. 
##### Contact list

I had to make this up myself based on #741. And yes, this has been done with MS Paint:
![contact-list-with locks1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428418/bb727eb2-ac46-11e3-9d88-e84acd5fbac4.png)

##### Message history

As far as I know this is still missing, at least I didn't find a specific issue about it and therefore didn't find any screenshots.
##### Discussion
1. There is no coherent visual security schema for TS. We need one schema for all these three areas in TS: contact list, message history, messaging window.
2. Too much information and too much redundancy which leads to a cluttered and less usable interface. There is no ""security at one glance"". 
3. The icons under each message are too small. Visually impaired people might not even notice them. Those symbols don't increase with the chosen text size. Also, depending on the colour, the icons under each message are hard to read because the contrast is too low. Another issue with those icons is that there could be issues on smaller screens with less dpi.
4. The lock symbol used on the contact list doesn't visualize the idea of three security levels well enough. Threema's indicator does so by telling the user that there are three levels and contrasting it with how many he already has achieved. I think this schema also presents an incentive to gain better security which the uni-coloured lock symbol doesn't.
### III. The alternative model

I have used Threema's dots to implement the security indicator but I have also ""designed"" some other possible indicators (see below). Maybe it's not even possible to use Threema's dots due to legal reasons. This is only an example. 

Bear with me, I really don't know my way around a real graphics program so this is all done with MS Paint... ;) 
##### Contact list

![contact-list - kopie](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428435/0c95c7bc-ac48-11e3-9b1e-2121ae85c152.png)
##### Messaging window

##### Message history

![message-history](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428434/0c859752-ac48-11e3-9684-bfbca26a338e.png)
##### Short explanation of how this model works:

First of: Threema doesn't use SMS, so TS has an enhanced model and more use cases.

Level 1 (red): The user is communicating via SMS. It doesn't matter if the number of his contact is already in his contact list. As far as I know, SMS can be easily fabricated so it doesn't even matter if the user receives encrypted SMS, because the other party could be anybody, at least as long as there has been no verification of keys. So whether the user is communicationg via encrypted or unencrypted SMS, with the number in his address book or not, doesn't matter. The only possibility to communicate securely over SMS is to use TS with a verified contact, which would result in a green indicator.

Level 2 (orange): This is for push messages that come from contacts in the usuer's address book which are not yet verified. Encryption is being used. **EDIT:** We should award SMS an orange indicator if there have been previous push messages and we already know that the key is connected to that number. In the case where a SMS reaches our phone from somebody unknown to us, this SMS will still have a red indicator.

Level 3 (green): The user has verified the contact from his contact list and uses encryption. 
##### Discussion:
1. Only one message colour for everything. Message colour doesn't resemble security any more, only the security indicator does. The message colour can be any colour we choose and it should be customizable in the future anyway. Though the colour should probably not be the green, orange or red of the security indicator so that people don't get confused. Also we need better contrast with the timestamp.
2. The user can understand the security level with one glance at the security indicator. No locks, no verification badges and no transport symbols under the messages. No tiny symbols, that can't be ready by visually impaired people or won't be displayed correctly on lew-res screens. Colour-vision impaired people can still see which security level is being used. 
   This leaves more room for what the user actually wants: communicating. I think we are too much in his face, constantly displaying something. Under each message there will only be a timestamp. I think there should be a warning message if a contact with two numbers (one of them isn't registered with TS) talks to the user and the security changes. Only switching to a red indicator probably doesn't cut it. Again, the indicator always tells you the security of your _next_ message. If you want to know the security of your last messages, you will have to tap and hold on a message so that you can access message details. 
3. Not displaying transportation under each message might be unwise, because users who pay for SMS or Data depending on usage really want to know what TS is doing. I think the solution to this is asking the user at first start how TS should handle this. As far as I know this will be or already has been integrated into TS so we probably don't have to worry about it that much. This means either TS is not allowed to act in a way that would cost the user money or TS will ask the user what to do. The way of transportation will always be in sight, though, because the text in the message composing area will always display whether the next message will be a SMS or push message. The only thing that I would wish somebody would add is that I could allow TS to use SMS for 15min, a few hours or a day, but ask me again once this time is over. 
4. The paperlane doesn't have a lock anymore either.
### IV. Some ideas for security indicators

This indicator needs to convey three levels of security and the user should always get the idea that more is better. 

Again, purely MS paint.

This is the modified TS icon:

Can anybody think of more?
### V. Conclusion

Ok, this is the model I wanted to propose. Feedback is very welcome. It would also help a lot if somebody could just make new, more professional looking mockups of the screenshots.

"431",20980572,"closed","Vision","I'm having my bro test out the extension.  He was not a Clef user prior to me asking him to test the extension.  He is a pretty medium amount of tech savvy.  In my head, he's pretty much exactly the market that Waltz is targeting.

Among some technical issues, his primary feedback is that he no longer understands what Clef does.  He originally understood that Clef was a password **replacement** (which it is).  However, the extension brands itself as Clef - we spin the Clef logo, that huge Clef-branded wave page pops up, you use the Clef app.  It feels _a lot_ like the extension _is_ Clef.  This made my brother think that Clef was actually a password locker.

So there's some things that need to be answered and thought about here:
- What is Waltz?  Is it an extension of Clef?  Is it a password manager that just happens to use Clef?  Is it both?  Do we want to market it in one way so it explicitly doesn't seem like the other?
- What are our goals with Waltz?  Is it purely a ""growth hack"" to increase the visibility of Clef?  Are we actually trying to build a password manager that does security better than the competition?
- How can we clearly communicate this unusual relationship with Clef to the user?
- Does our target user _care_?  If they just put in a password and never think about it again, will they not know the difference between that and Clef?  Or are we working with techies who throw red flags when giving out their passwords?
- At what point are we diluting the Clef brand so much that Waltz is more harm than good?

"441",28332383,"closed","improve 'send encrypted' icon","The icon for indicating to the user that the message is going to be sent encrypted is the paper plane with a green lock icon overlaid. The lock is rotated 90deg.

Two issues:
- Encrypted messages are colored blue, not green.
  The overlaid lock icon should be blue, if any color.
- The icon is rotated 90deg. The lock has rounded corners and and the arch of the lock is much smaller. All other lock icons used throughout TS do not have rounded corners and have a larger arch to be better recognizable. Accordingly, the lock on the paper plane should be a scaled version of `ic_menu_lock_...png` at the resp. size and same orientation.
